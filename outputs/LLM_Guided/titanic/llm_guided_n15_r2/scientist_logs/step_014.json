Ensure all categorical columns are cast to strings before passing to CatBoost. This should be a simple and efficient implementation.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing model so far is CatBoost with specific hyperparameter tuning, achieving a score of 0.9091. The recent failures were due to exceeding the action budget, likely because of overly complex or lengthy code. Since we have only one node remaining, it's crucial to refine the best approach with minimal changes. The CatBoost model with iterations=720, learning_rate=0.017, and depth=6 performed well, so we should make a slight adjustment to the learning rate to see if it can improve further.",
