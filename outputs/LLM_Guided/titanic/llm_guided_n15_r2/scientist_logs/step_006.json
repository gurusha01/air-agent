  "reasoning": "The LightGBM model has shown the best performance so far, with a score of 0.8684. The last attempt with LightGBM slightly decreased the score, suggesting that the hyperparameters might have been too aggressive. To further refine the LightGBM model, I will try a slightly different set of hyperparameters to see if we can push the accuracy higher.
