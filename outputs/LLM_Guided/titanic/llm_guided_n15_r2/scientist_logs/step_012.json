  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 0.9091. The last attempt with CatBoost failed due to a likely issue with token limits, so we should avoid making the script too long or complex. Since CatBoost is performing well, we should continue refining it. The previous best configuration was with iterations=720, learning_rate=0.017, and depth=6. Let's try a slight variation in hyperparameters to see if we can improve the score further.",
