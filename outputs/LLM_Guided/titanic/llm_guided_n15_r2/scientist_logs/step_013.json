  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 0.9091. The executor has had difficulties with further hyperparameter tuning, resulting in failures due to token limits. Given the limited actions remaining, it's best to refine the CatBoost model with slight hyperparameter adjustments, as this approach has consistently yielded high scores. We should aim for a small, concrete variation that might improve or at least maintain the current performance.",
