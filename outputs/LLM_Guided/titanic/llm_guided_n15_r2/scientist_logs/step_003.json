If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before encoding.",

  "reasoning": "The gradient-boosted tree model (Node root_0) performed the best with a score of 0.8445, indicating that tree-based models are effective for this task. The neural network (Node root_1) also performed well but not as well as the tree model. The k-nearest neighbors (Node root_2) performed poorly, suggesting that it may not be suitable for this dataset without significant feature engineering. Given the budget of 12 nodes remaining, we should focus on refining the best-performing model (gradient-boosted tree) with slight variations to improve the score further.",
