  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has shown the highest accuracy so far, achieving a score of 0.9091. This suggests that CatBoost is well-suited for the Titanic dataset, especially when categorical features are handled correctly. The node root_0_0_0_2_2 has the best score, and since we have limited nodes left, it makes sense to refine this approach further. We should try slight hyperparameter adjustments to see if we can push the accuracy even higher.",
