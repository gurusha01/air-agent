The subsequent attempt to refine it in node root_0_0_0_2_0 resulted in a lower score, suggesting that the hyperparameter adjustments were not optimal. Given the success of CatBoost, it makes sense to further refine this approach. Since we have 6 nodes remaining, we can afford to make a couple more attempts to optimize CatBoost's hyperparameters.",
