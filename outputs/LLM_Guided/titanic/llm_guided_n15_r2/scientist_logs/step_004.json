This suggests that gradient-boosted tree models are effective for the Titanic dataset. To further improve performance, we should continue refining the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model. Additionally, since we have not yet tried a Random Forest model, it would be beneficial to explore this model family as well, given its robustness and ability to handle categorical data effectively.",
