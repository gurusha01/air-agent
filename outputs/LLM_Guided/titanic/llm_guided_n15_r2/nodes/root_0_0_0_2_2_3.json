This should be a simple and efficient implementation.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use CatBoost with these settings: iterations=720, learning_rate=0.017, depth=6. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and apply a simple box-cox transformation to the 'age' feature to reduce skewness and improve the model's ability to capture subtle age-related survival patterns. Keep all categorical features as strings and pass them directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. This small transformation helps stabilize the age distribution, which is highly skewed, and may improve gradient flow during training without altering the core methodology.)",
