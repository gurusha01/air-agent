For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and apply a simple box-cox transformation to the 'fare' feature to further reduce skewness and improve feature stability, especially in the tails of the distribution. Keep all categorical features as strings and pass them directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. This variation enhances the transformation of fare beyond a simple log, potentially capturing more nuanced nonlinearity while maintaining the same core methodology.)",
