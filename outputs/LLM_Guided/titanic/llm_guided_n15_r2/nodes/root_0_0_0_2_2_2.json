For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and apply a log transformation to the 'fare' feature to reduce skewness. Keep all categorical features as strings and pass them directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. This slight increase in learning rate with a moderate reduction in iterations may improve convergence speed and allow better optimization of the loss function, especially in the presence of skewed fare data, without overfitting.)",
