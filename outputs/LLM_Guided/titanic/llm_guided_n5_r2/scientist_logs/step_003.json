For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median of each column, and drop any columns with more than 50% missing values.

  "reasoning": "Node root_1 achieved the best score with a neural network approach, which is not ideal given the executor's limitations. Node root_0, which used a gradient-boosted tree model, performed poorly, possibly due to complex feature interactions. Node root_2 failed due to a KeyError, likely from incorrect data handling. Given the constraints, it is best to refine the approach from root_1 by using a simpler model that the executor can handle well, such as CatBoost, which can handle categorical features directly. This should improve the score while staying within the executor's capabilities.",
