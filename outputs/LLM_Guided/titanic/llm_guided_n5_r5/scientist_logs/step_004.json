  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far used a gradient-boosting model (LightGBM) with targeted categorical encoding. However, it failed due to a mismatch in categorical features between train and validation datasets. This suggests a need for consistent preprocessing across datasets. The random forest approach performed poorly, and the neural network approach was too complex for the executor. Given the limited nodes left, we should refine the best working approach, LightGBM, with careful preprocessing to ensure consistency.",
