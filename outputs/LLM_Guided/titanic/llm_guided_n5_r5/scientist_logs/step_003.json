  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far used a gradient-boosting model, likely due to its ability to handle complex interactions and non-linear relationships. The failed node attempted a deep neural network, which was too complex for the executor, leading to dtype errors. The random forest node underperformed, possibly due to ineffective feature selection or model settings. Given our limited nodes, we should refine the successful gradient-boosting approach with slight variations to improve accuracy further.",
