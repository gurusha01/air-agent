Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and dropping columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost without encoding. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical features to strings before passing them to the model.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with native handling of categorical features has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 0.8589. Attempts with LightGBM and RandomForestClassifier have not surpassed this score. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it makes sense to further refine the CatBoost model with small hyperparameter tweaks to see if we can improve the score further. We should also ensure that preprocessing steps are optimal and consistent with previous successful attempts.",
