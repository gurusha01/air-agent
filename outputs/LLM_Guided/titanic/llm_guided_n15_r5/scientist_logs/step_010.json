Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and dropping columns with more than 50% missing data. Use the `cat_features` parameter in CatBoost to handle categorical variables. If you encounter dtype errors, ensure all categorical variables are cast to strings before fitting the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that categorical variables are properly identified and passed to the `cat_features` parameter. Avoid using one-hot encoding or get_dummies for categorical features, as CatBoost handles them natively. Double-check that all missing values are handled before model training.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has shown the best performance so far, with a score of 0.8612. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it's prudent to refine this approach further. Small adjustments to hyperparameters could yield a slight improvement. Additionally, since CatBoost handles categorical features well, we should ensure that the preprocessing is optimized for this model.",
