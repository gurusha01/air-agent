The attempt to further optimize CatBoost in node root_3_0 did not improve the score, suggesting that the initial hyperparameters were close to optimal. LightGBM failed due to errors, and RandomForestClassifier achieved a decent score but not as high as CatBoost. Given the remaining nodes, I will attempt to refine the CatBoost model one more time with a small hyperparameter adjustment to see if we can slightly improve the score.",
