  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently provided the best results, with the highest score achieved at node root_3_2. Since we are limited in nodes, it makes sense to refine this approach further. The CatBoost model is performing well due to its native handling of categorical features, which is crucial for the Titanic dataset. We should try a slight variation in hyperparameters to see if we can improve the score further.",
