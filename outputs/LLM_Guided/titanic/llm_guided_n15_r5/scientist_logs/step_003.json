  "direction": "Use CatBoostClassifier with the following settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and dropping columns with more than 50% missing values. For categorical features, pass them directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure that all categorical data is cast to string type to avoid dtype errors.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle NaN values in numeric columns by filling them with the median. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass them directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string to prevent dtype errors.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost can handle categorical features natively, reducing the risk of dtype errors and simplifying preprocessing.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts have failed due to various issues, including errors with feature selection and dtype mismatches. The baseline score of 0.7655 suggests that a simple model might perform adequately. Since complex models and preprocessing steps have led to errors, we should focus on a straightforward approach using a robust model like CatBoost, which handles categorical features natively and is less prone to errors related to encoding. This will allow us to avoid issues with dtype mismatches and complex feature engineering.",
