Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and encoding categorical features using LightGBM's native handling. Ensure that categorical features are specified using the 'categorical_feature' parameter in LightGBM. Use the 'PassengerId' column as the index and drop it from the features. Use 'Survived' as the target variable.\n\n(VS suggestion: Apply a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, using a custom pipeline that applies one-hot encoding to all categorical variables and performs standardized scaling on numerical features. Introduce interaction terms between 'Pclass' and 'Age' by creating a new feature 'Pclass_Age_interaction = Pclass * Age', and then use this as a primary input to the SVM. Evaluate using cross-validation with stratified splits to ensure robustness.)",
