For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LabelEncoder for categorical variables. Drop columns with more than 50% missing values. If you encounter any dtype issues, ensure all categorical variables are cast to strings before encoding.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle NaN values in all columns before encoding. Do not use get_dummies as it can increase memory usage significantly. Instead, use LabelEncoder for categorical variables. If you encounter a dtype conversion error, check that all categorical variables are strings before encoding.",

  "memory_update": "The random forest model with class-balanced sampling is currently the best-performing approach, suggesting that handling class imbalance is crucial for this task.",
  "reasoning": "The random forest model with class-balanced sampling achieved the highest score of 0.8541, indicating it's a strong candidate. The gradient-boosted tree model also performed well with a score of 0.8493. The deep neural network failed due to dtype conversion issues, which suggests that complex models may not be suitable for this task given the executor's limitations. With only two nodes remaining, it's prudent to refine the best-performing approach, which is the random forest model, by adjusting hyperparameters or adding a simple feature engineering step.",
