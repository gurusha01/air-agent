  "reasoning": "The random forest model with class-balanced sampling has shown the best performance so far, achieving an accuracy of 0.8541. This suggests that handling class imbalance is crucial for this task. Given that we have only one node remaining, it is prudent to refine this approach further with small tweaks to potentially improve the score. Specifically, we can try adjusting the hyperparameters of the RandomForestClassifier to see if we can achieve a better result.",
