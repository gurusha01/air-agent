For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings first.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that you handle NaN values appropriately before passing data to the model. Avoid using get_dummies as it can lead to memory issues; instead, rely on CatBoost's native handling of categorical features.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly could provide a similar advantage to neural networks without the complexity.",
  "reasoning": "The neural network approach (Node root_1) achieved the highest score of 0.8541, which indicates that leveraging feature learning with embeddings for categorical variables was effective. However, given the constraints and the executor's capabilities, we should avoid neural networks and focus on simpler models that can still leverage categorical features effectively. CatBoost is known for handling categorical variables well and might offer a similar advantage without the complexity of neural networks. We have two nodes left, so we should explore CatBoost with a focus on categorical handling and hyperparameter tuning.",
