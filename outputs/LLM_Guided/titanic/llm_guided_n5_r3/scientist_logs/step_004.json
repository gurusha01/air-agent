  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters (iterations=700, learning_rate=0.02, depth=7) achieved the highest score of 0.8780. This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly is advantageous for this dataset. Given that we have only one node remaining, it is prudent to refine this approach with a minor tweak to potentially improve the score further.
