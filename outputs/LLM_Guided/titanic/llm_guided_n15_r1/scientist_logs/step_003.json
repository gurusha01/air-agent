  "direction": "Use a logistic regression model with the following settings: solver='liblinear', max_iter=200. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LabelEncoder for categorical features such as 'Sex', 'Embarked', and 'Pclass'. Drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. Evaluate the model using accuracy.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle NaN values in the dataset before encoding categorical features. Do NOT use one-hot encoding as it may increase dimensionality unnecessarily. Use LabelEncoder instead for simplicity.",

  "memory_update": "Logistic regression with basic preprocessing is a viable next step due to its simplicity and efficiency on structured datasets.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts have shown that complex approaches like neural networks and recursive feature elimination are too ambitious and exceed the action budget. The gradient boosting model with target encoding also performed worse than the baseline. We need to focus on simpler models that can be implemented within the constraints and improve upon the baseline. A logistic regression model with basic preprocessing might be a good candidate to try next, as it is simple and often performs well on structured datasets like Titanic.",
