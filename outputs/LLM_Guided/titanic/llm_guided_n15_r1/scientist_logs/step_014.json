For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with >50% missing values, and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical features to strings before passing them to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that categorical features are correctly identified and passed to the `cat_features` parameter in CatBoost. Do not use one-hot encoding or get_dummies, as CatBoost handles categorical features natively. If you encounter any dtype issues, convert categorical columns to strings.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameter tuning has consistently shown the best performance, achieving the highest accuracy score of 0.9330. Given that we have only one node remaining, it is prudent to further refine the CatBoost approach by making a small adjustment to the hyperparameters to potentially improve the score. The previous attempts with CatBoost have shown that adjusting iterations, learning rate, and depth can lead to significant improvements.",
