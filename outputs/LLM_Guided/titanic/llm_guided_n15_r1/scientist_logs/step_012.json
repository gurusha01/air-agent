  "direction": "Use a CatBoostClassifier with the following settings: iterations=650, learning_rate=0.028, depth=7. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing data. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that you handle NaN values appropriately before passing the data to the model. Do not use one-hot encoding for categorical features; use CatBoost's native handling by specifying cat_features. Be cautious of dtype errors and cast categorical features to strings if necessary.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's hyperparameter tuning, specifically iterations, learning rate, and depth, has consistently shown potential for high accuracy in this task.",
  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameter tuning has yielded the highest accuracy score so far. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to further refine the CatBoost model to potentially improve the score. The previous attempts with CatBoost have shown that adjusting the number of iterations, learning rate, and depth can impact performance. Therefore, a slight variation in these hyperparameters may lead to an improvement.",
