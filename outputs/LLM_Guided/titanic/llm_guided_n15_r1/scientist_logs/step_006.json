  "reasoning": "The RandomForestClassifier with specific preprocessing achieved the best score so far. Logistic regression failed due to a KeyError related to the 'Cabin' column, which suggests that handling missing values is crucial. The DecisionTreeClassifier performed decently but not as well as the RandomForest. Given the remaining nodes, we should refine the RandomForest approach to see if we can improve the score further by adjusting hyperparameters or preprocessing steps.",
