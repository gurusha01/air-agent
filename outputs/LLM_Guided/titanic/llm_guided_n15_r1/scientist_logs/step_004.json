For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median of each column, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LabelEncoder for categorical columns. Ensure that the 'Cabin' column is handled properly by either dropping it if it's mostly missing or encoding it if it's useful. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing, and evaluate using accuracy.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle the 'Cabin' column by checking its missing value percentage. If it's more than 50% missing, drop it. Otherwise, encode it properly. Use LabelEncoder for all categorical columns to avoid potential issues with get_dummies.",

  "memory_update": "The 'Cabin' column requires careful handling due to potential missing values, which previously caused a KeyError.",
  "reasoning": "The logistic regression approach failed due to a KeyError related to the 'Cabin' column. This suggests that the column was either missing or improperly handled in preprocessing. The best score so far was with the baseline, so we should aim for a simple model with robust preprocessing. A decision tree model could be a good next step due to its simplicity and ability to handle missing values internally. We will use basic preprocessing and a decision tree classifier to see if we can improve upon the baseline.",
