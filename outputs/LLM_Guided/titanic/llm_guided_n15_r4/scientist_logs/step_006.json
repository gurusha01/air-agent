For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, convert categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that categorical features are correctly identified and passed to the cat_features parameter in CatBoost. Do not use one-hot encoding or get_dummies, as CatBoost can handle categorical variables natively. Make sure to handle any NaN values in numeric columns by filling them with the median.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost can handle categorical features natively, potentially improving performance on datasets with categorical variables.",
  "reasoning": "The RandomForest approach with target encoding has shown promising results, achieving a score of 0.8565. This indicates that ensemble methods with proper handling of categorical variables are effective. The LightGBM attempt failed, likely due to preprocessing issues. We should explore another ensemble method, CatBoost, which handles categorical features natively and might offer further improvements. This will diversify our approach while staying within the executor's capabilities.",
