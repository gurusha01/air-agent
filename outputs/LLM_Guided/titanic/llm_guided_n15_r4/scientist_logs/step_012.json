This suggests that CatBoost's handling of categorical features is effective for this dataset. We have not yet tried hyperparameter tuning with LightGBM successfully, as previous attempts failed due to errors. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to focus on refining the CatBoost model further to maximize the score.",
