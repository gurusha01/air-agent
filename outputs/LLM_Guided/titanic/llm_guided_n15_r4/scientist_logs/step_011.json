Given our limited nodes, it's prudent to further refine the CatBoost approach with slight hyperparameter adjustments to potentially improve the score. The LightGBM attempts failed due to unseen labels and other issues, suggesting it's not the best focus right now. We should exploit the CatBoost model further.",
