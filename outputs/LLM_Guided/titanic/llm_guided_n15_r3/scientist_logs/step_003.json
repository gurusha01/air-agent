For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LightGBM's built-in handling for categorical features by specifying the categorical_feature parameter. Drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Ensure that all categorical columns are cast to strings before passing them to LightGBM. Use train/test split with a test size of 0.2 and random_state=42 for reproducibility.",

Make sure to handle NaN values in numeric columns by filling them with the median before training. If you encounter a dtype error, ensure all categorical columns are cast to strings.",

  "memory_update": "LightGBM is a suitable model choice due to its ability to handle categorical features directly, which aligns well with the executor's capabilities.",
  "reasoning": "The neural network approach in Node root_1 achieved a score of 0.8541, which is significantly better than the baseline. This suggests that the executor can handle models with embedded embeddings for categorical variables. However, neural networks are not the most efficient approach for this task given the executor's limitations. The failures in Nodes root_0 and root_2 indicate issues with complex feature engineering and incorrect data handling. We should avoid complex transformations and focus on simpler, more robust models. Given the executor's strengths, a LightGBM model would be a good candidate to try next, as it can handle categorical variables directly and is generally efficient.",
