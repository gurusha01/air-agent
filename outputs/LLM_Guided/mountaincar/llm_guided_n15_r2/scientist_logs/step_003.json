The failed node attempted to use a TD3 agent, which was too complex for the executor. To improve upon the current best score, we should explore another model family that the executor can handle, such as a reinforcement learning approach using a simpler model like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with specific hyperparameters. This approach is simpler than TD3 and should be within the executor's capabilities.",
