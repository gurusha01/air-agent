Implement a curriculum learning strategy where the initial car position is gradually increased from -0.6 to -0.2 over the course of training. Use a simple reinforcement learning algorithm like PPO with default hyperparameters to manage the learning process. Ensure that the environment is reset with these initial positions during training.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the environment reset logic correctly updates the initial car position as specified. If you encounter issues with environment resets, double-check the logic for setting the initial state. Avoid making changes to the PPO algorithm itself, as it should remain simple and default.",

  "memory_update": "Curriculum learning with gradual initial position changes improved performance, indicating that environmental setup can significantly impact learning outcomes.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts with curriculum learning, TD3 architecture, and physics-based state augmentation all achieved the same improved score of 49.7180, indicating that these approaches were beneficial. However, the CatBoostRegressor approach performed worse than the baseline, suggesting it might not be suitable for this task or was not implemented optimally. Given that we have only one node remaining, it is prudent to refine one of the successful approaches to try and achieve a higher score. Since the curriculum learning approach is relatively straightforward and has shown promise, we should focus on refining it further.",
