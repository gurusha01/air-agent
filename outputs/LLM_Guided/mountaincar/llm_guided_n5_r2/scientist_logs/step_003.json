  "reasoning": "The previous nodes have achieved a score of 49.7180, which is a significant improvement over the baseline. However, the approaches used were likely too complex for the executor to handle efficiently, as they involved advanced reinforcement learning techniques. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, we should focus on a simpler, more traditional machine learning approach that the executor can implement well. We haven't yet tried a traditional regression model, which could be a good fit for this task. Let's try using a CatBoost regressor, which is known for its ease of use and effectiveness on tabular data.",
