  "strategy": "Refine the reward shaping scheme by introducing a continuous reward signal that increases as the car gets closer to the goal. Use the following approach:\n1. Implement a reward function that gives a higher reward as the car's position approaches the goal position (0.5).\n2. Use a linear scaling factor to adjust the reward based on the car's position.\n3. Keep the rest of the environment and agent setup the same as in the previous attempt.\n\n(VS suggestion: Introduce a multi-stage sparse reward shaping scheme by rewarding the agent at three intermediate milestones: (1) reaching position 0.25, (2) reaching velocity 0.1, and (3) reaching position 0.5. Each milestone provides a small positive reward (e.g., 1.0), and the final goal reward remains unchanged. This creates a more structured progression of exploration, encouraging the agent to build momentum through staged rewards, which may help in navigating the steep potential well of the MountainCar environment more effectively.)",
