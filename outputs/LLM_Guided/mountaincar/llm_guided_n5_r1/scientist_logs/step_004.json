  "direction": "Enhance the reward shaping scheme by combining the existing binary reward signal with a continuous component. The continuous component should provide a small reward proportional to the car's velocity towards the goal. Use the existing binary reward signal to reward the agent when the car reaches the flag, and add a continuous reward that increases as the car's velocity in the direction of the goal increases. This should be implemented in a single script with a maximum of 100 lines.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the continuous reward component is small enough not to overshadow the binary reward signal. If you encounter issues with the reward calculation, double-check the velocity component and ensure it is correctly oriented towards the goal.",

  "memory_update": "Combining binary and continuous reward signals might yield better performance by encouraging progress towards the goal while still rewarding goal achievement.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts showed that reward shaping with a binary signal improved performance significantly. However, further attempts to refine the reward shaping with a continuous signal did not yield additional improvements. Using a CNN for feature extraction also improved performance, but it might be too complex for the executor to handle efficiently. Given that we have one node left, we should focus on refining the reward shaping approach, as it has shown the most promise. A simple yet potentially effective approach could be to combine the binary reward signal with a small continuous component that rewards the agent for moving closer to the goal.",
