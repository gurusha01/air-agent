Implement a reward function that gives a higher reward as the car's position approaches the goal position (0.5).\n2. Use a linear scaling factor to adjust the reward based on the car's position.\n3. Keep the rest of the environment and agent setup the same as in the previous attempt.",

  "reasoning": "Node root_1 and root_2 achieved the same improved score of 49.7180, indicating that the reward shaping scheme and CNN-based approach both have potential. However, given the constraints of the executor, the CNN approach might be too complex. The reward shaping scheme seems more promising and feasible for further refinement. We should focus on refining this approach by adjusting the reward shaping parameters or introducing additional simple modifications.",
