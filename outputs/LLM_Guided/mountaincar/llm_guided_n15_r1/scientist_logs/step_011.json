  "reasoning": "The TD3 framework has shown the best results so far, with a score of 51.3875. The other approaches, such as SARSA and discrete-time feature engineering, have also improved upon the baseline but did not surpass TD3. The attempts to use linear regression and XGBoost failed or resulted in extremely poor scores, indicating that these approaches are not suitable for this task. Given the limited nodes remaining, we should focus on refining the TD3 approach further, as it has the highest potential for improvement.",
