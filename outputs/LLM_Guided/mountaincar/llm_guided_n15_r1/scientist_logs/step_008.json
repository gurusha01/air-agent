Set the following hyperparameters: learning_rate=0.0003, batch_size=256, buffer_size=1000000, tau=0.005, gamma=0.99, and train_freq=1. Ensure the environment is properly reset and normalized before training. Use a standard SAC implementation from a library like Stable Baselines3.",

  "memory_update": "Continuous action space methods like TD3 and potentially SAC are promising for the Mountain Car Continuous task, offering significant improvements over baseline scores.",
  "reasoning": "The TD3 approach yielded the best score so far, indicating that continuous action space methods are effective for this task. However, the XGBoost approach failed drastically, suggesting that tree-based models might not be suitable for this problem. Given the remaining budget, it's prudent to explore another continuous action space method, specifically the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which is known for its robustness in continuous control tasks. This will diversify our exploration while leveraging the success of similar methods.",
