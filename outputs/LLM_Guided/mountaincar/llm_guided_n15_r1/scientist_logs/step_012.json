  "memory_update": "TD3 with specific hyperparameter tuning and reward scaling has shown potential for improving performance on the Mountain Car Continuous task.",
  "reasoning": "The best-performing approach so far has been using the Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) framework, which significantly improved the baseline score. However, further refinements of TD3 did not yield better results, indicating that the current hyperparameter settings might have reached a local optimum. The XGBoost approach failed dramatically, suggesting that it might not be suitable for this task without significant adjustments. Given the limited nodes remaining, it makes sense to refine the TD3 approach further with a focus on hyperparameter tuning, as it has shown promise. We should aim to explore a new simple model as well, to ensure diversity.",
