If you encounter errors with feature scaling, try using StandardScaler instead.",

  "reasoning": "The TD3 algorithm has shown the best performance so far, indicating that continuous action space methods are effective for this task. However, we have not yet explored simpler models like SARSA with function approximation in depth, which could still offer competitive results. Given our remaining budget, we should try a new model family that the executor can handle, such as XGBoost, which is known for its robustness and efficiency. We will use it with a regression objective to handle the continuous action space.",
