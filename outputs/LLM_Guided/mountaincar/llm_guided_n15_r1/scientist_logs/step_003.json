Set the following hyperparameters: learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.99, epsilon=0.1 for epsilon-greedy policy. Use a simple feature transformation: scale the position and velocity to the range [0, 1]. Implement the algorithm in a single script, ensuring it remains under 100 lines of code.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the feature scaling is applied correctly before training. Do not attempt to implement complex neural network architectures; stick to linear function approximation. If you encounter convergence issues, consider adjusting the learning rate or epsilon value slightly.",

  "memory_update": "Continuous action space methods like TD3 are promising, but simpler algorithms like SARSA with function approximation have not yet been explored and could offer competitive results.",
  "reasoning": "The Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) framework achieved the best score so far, indicating that continuous action space methods are promising. However, we have not yet explored simpler, more traditional reinforcement learning algorithms that the executor can handle well, such as SARSA or Q-learning with function approximation. Given our budget, it makes sense to explore a simpler model that might provide a competitive score with less complexity.",
