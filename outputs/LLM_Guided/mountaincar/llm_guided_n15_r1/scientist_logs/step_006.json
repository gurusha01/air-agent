  "direction": "Implement a linear regression model with function approximation for the Mountain Car Continuous task. Use the following settings:\n- Normalize the input features (position and velocity) to have zero mean and unit variance.\n- Use a polynomial feature transformation of degree 2 to capture non-linear relationships.\n- Train the model using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.01 and a maximum of 1000 iterations.\n- Evaluate the model using the mean reward metric.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the input features are normalized before applying the polynomial transformation. If you encounter convergence issues, consider adjusting the learning rate or the number of iterations.",

  "memory_update": "Exploring simpler models with function approximation could provide competitive results for the Mountain Car Continuous task.",
  "reasoning": "The TD3 approach has shown the best improvement over the baseline, indicating that continuous action space methods are effective for this task. However, we have not yet fully explored simpler models with function approximation, which could provide competitive results. Given the remaining budget, it is prudent to explore a new model family that the executor can handle, such as a simple linear regression model with function approximation, which might offer a balance between complexity and performance.",
