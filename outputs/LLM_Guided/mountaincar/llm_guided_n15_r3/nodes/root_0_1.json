  "strategy": "Implement a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework using a goal-directed policy. Use the Stable Baselines3 library with the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, which is known for handling continuous action spaces effectively. Set the hyperparameters as follows: learning_rate=0.001, buffer_size=100000, learning_starts=1000, batch_size=256, tau=0.02, gamma=0.99, train_freq=64, gradient_steps=64. Ensure to preprocess the state space by normalizing the input features. If you encounter issues with the SAC implementation, consider simplifying the model by reducing the buffer_size to 50000 and batch_size to 128.\n\n(VS suggestion: Introduce a dynamic goal thresholding mechanism where the high-level policy updates the goal positions based on the agent's current state (e.g., position and velocity) to ensure goals are always reachable and progressively scaled. For example, if the agent is in the lower valley, the goal is set to a slightly higher position than the current state, but only if the agent can reach it with a small amount of acceleration. This adaptive goal spacing prevents premature goal transitions and avoids getting stuck in suboptimal local regions. Additionally, use a soft goal reward function that gives a positive bonus when the agent approaches the goal within a small tolerance (e.g., \u00b10.1 of the goal position), encouraging smooth transitions without abrupt policy shifts. This variation maintains the HRL structure while improving goal relevance and continuity in the learning process.)",
