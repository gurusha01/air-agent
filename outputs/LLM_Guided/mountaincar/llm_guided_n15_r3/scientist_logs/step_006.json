  "reasoning": "The hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with goal-directed policy and reward shaping techniques have shown significant improvements over the baseline. However, attempts to implement these approaches with different algorithms (PPO, SAC) have not yielded better results than the initial HRL framework. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) showed some improvement but not as much as HRL. Given the remaining nodes, it is prudent to explore a simpler model that the executor can handle, such as a standard reinforcement learning algorithm from the Stable Baselines3 library, like DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), which is suitable for continuous action spaces like Mountain Car Continuous.",
