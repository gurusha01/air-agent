Use the following settings: n_steps=2048, batch_size=64, n_epochs=10, learning_rate=0.0003. For preprocessing, normalize the state inputs to have zero mean and unit variance. If you encounter issues with the environment, ensure that the action space is properly handled by using a continuous action space wrapper.",

  "memory_update": "Reward shaping and hierarchical learning approaches have shown significant improvements over the baseline, suggesting these techniques are effective for the Mountain Car Continuous task.",
  "reasoning": "The nodes that performed better than the baseline used techniques that likely introduced some form of reward shaping or hierarchical learning. The node using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) improved slightly over the baseline, but not as significantly as the other two. This suggests that simpler methods with reward shaping or hierarchical structures might be more effective for this task. Given the current budget of 12 nodes, we can afford to explore a new model family while also refining the best-performing approach.",
