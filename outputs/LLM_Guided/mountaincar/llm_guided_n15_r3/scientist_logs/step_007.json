Use reward shaping by introducing a synthetic reward signal based on the car's velocity in addition to its position. Set the PPO hyperparameters as follows: n_steps=2048, batch_size=64, n_epochs=10, gamma=0.99, learning_rate=0.0003. Ensure the environment is wrapped to normalize observations and rewards.",

  "reasoning": "The hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with goal-directed policy and reward shaping has shown significant improvements over the baseline, indicating these techniques are effective for the Mountain Car Continuous task. The DDPG algorithm, however, performed poorly, suggesting it might not be suitable for this task or requires different tuning. Since HRL with reward shaping has been effective, we should explore further improvements in this area. Given our budget of 8 nodes, we can afford to try a new approach while refining the best-performing one.",
