Use the Stable Baselines3 library with the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, which is known for handling continuous action spaces effectively. Set the hyperparameters as follows: learning_rate=0.001, buffer_size=100000, learning_starts=1000, batch_size=256, tau=0.02, gamma=0.99, train_freq=64, gradient_steps=64.

If you encounter issues with the SAC implementation, consider simplifying the model by reducing the buffer_size to 50000 and batch_size to 128.",

  "reasoning": "The hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework and reward shaping techniques have both shown significant improvements over the baseline. However, the attempt to use Stable Baselines3 with PPO resulted in a negative score, indicating that the approach might have been too complex or not well-suited for the executor's capabilities. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach showed a slight improvement but not as much as the HRL and reward shaping. Given the remaining budget, it's prudent to refine the successful HRL approach further.",
