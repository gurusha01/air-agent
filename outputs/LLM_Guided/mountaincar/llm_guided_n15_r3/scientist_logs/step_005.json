For preprocessing, normalize the state inputs to have zero mean and unit variance. If you encounter any errors with the SAC implementation, switch to the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm with similar hyperparameters.",

  "reasoning": "The hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with a goal-directed policy has shown significant improvement over the baseline. Additionally, reward shaping techniques have also demonstrated effectiveness. However, attempts to use PPO with Stable Baselines3 resulted in poor performance, likely due to complexity or incorrect implementation. Given the remaining nodes, it is prudent to further refine the HRL approach, as it has shown promise, and explore a new model family that the executor can handle.",
