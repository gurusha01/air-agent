  "direction": "Use the `stable-baselines3` library to implement a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent for the Mountain Car Continuous environment. Set up the environment using `gym.make('MountainCarContinuous-v0')`. Use the following hyperparameters for PPO: `n_steps=2048`, `batch_size=64`, `n_epochs=10`, `learning_rate=0.0003`, `gamma=0.99`. Train the model for 100,000 timesteps. After training, evaluate the model by running it in the environment for 10 episodes and calculate the mean reward. Ensure the evaluation script prints the metrics in JSON format.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the `stable-baselines3` library is installed and import the necessary modules correctly. If you encounter installation issues, use `pip install stable-baselines3`. Make sure the environment is correctly set up with `gym`. If you face any syntax errors, double-check the library documentation for correct usage patterns.",

  "memory_update": "Complex approaches with custom models are prone to syntax errors and running out of actions; simpler, library-based implementations are more feasible.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts failed due to overly complex approaches that the executor struggled to implement. The errors ranged from syntax issues to running out of actions without validation. Given the constraints, we should focus on a simpler, more straightforward approach that the executor can handle. Since we haven't yet tried a simple reinforcement learning algorithm that the executor can implement, let's attempt a basic implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm using a stable library like `stable-baselines3`.",
