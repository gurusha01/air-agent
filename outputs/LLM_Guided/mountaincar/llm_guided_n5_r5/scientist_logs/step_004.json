  "reasoning": "The previous attempts failed due to overly complex approaches and syntax errors, indicating that simpler, library-based implementations are more feasible. The baseline score is 33.7938, and we need to improve upon this with a straightforward approach. Given the constraints and the executor's capabilities, we should focus on using a well-supported reinforcement learning library like `stable-baselines3` with a simple agent configuration. The PPO agent is a good candidate, but we need to ensure that the implementation is straightforward and avoids complex customizations.",
