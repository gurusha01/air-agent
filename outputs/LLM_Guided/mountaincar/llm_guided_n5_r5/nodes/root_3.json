  "strategy": "Use the `stable-baselines3` library to implement a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent for the Mountain Car Continuous environment. Set up the environment using `gym.make('MountainCarContinuous-v0')`. Use the following hyperparameters for PPO: `n_steps=2048`, `batch_size=64`, `n_epochs=10`, `learning_rate=0.0003`, `gamma=0.99`. Train the model for 100,000 timesteps. After training, evaluate the model by running it in the environment for 10 episodes and calculate the mean reward. Ensure the evaluation script prints the metrics in JSON format.\n\n(VS suggestion: Replace the PPO agent with a Random Forest-based policy with continuous input trees that predict action probabilities using position and velocity as features, and use bootstrapped ensembles to reduce overfitting to noisy reward signals. This leverages tree-based non-parametric modeling for interpretability and robustness in a sparse reward environment, avoiding gradient-based optimization entirely.)",
