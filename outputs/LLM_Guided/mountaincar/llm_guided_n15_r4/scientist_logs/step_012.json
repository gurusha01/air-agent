Use the following settings:\n- Learning rate: 0.01\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Exploration strategy: epsilon-greedy with epsilon starting at 1.0 and decaying to 0.1 over 1000 episodes\n- Number of episodes: 2000\n- Use a simple linear function approximation for the Q-value\n- Update the Q-values using the Bellman equation",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the epsilon decay is implemented correctly to balance exploration and exploitation. If you encounter issues with convergence, consider adjusting the learning rate slightly. Avoid complex neural network architectures as they are beyond the executor's capabilities.",

  "memory_update": "Q-learning with linear approximation is the most promising approach for this task, and tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and exploration strategy can lead to further improvements.",
  "reasoning": "The Q-learning approach with linear approximation has consistently yielded the best results, achieving a score of 49.7180. This suggests that the approach is viable, but further improvements could be made by refining the hyperparameters. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it would be prudent to focus on exploiting this approach by fine-tuning the hyperparameters such as learning rate and exploration strategy. The SARSA algorithm and REINFORCE algorithm attempts did not perform well, indicating that they are not suitable for this task within the executor's constraints.",
