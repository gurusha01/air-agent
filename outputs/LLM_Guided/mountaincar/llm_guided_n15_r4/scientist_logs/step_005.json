Use the following settings:\n- Learning rate: 0.1\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Exploration strategy: epsilon-greedy with epsilon starting at 1.0 and decaying to 0.1 over 1000 episodes\n- Number of episodes: 2000\n- Use a simple linear function approximator for the Q-value estimation\n- Update the Q-values using the Bellman equation",

If you encounter issues with the Q-value updates, double-check the implementation of the Bellman equation and ensure that the learning rate and discount factor are applied correctly.",

  "memory_update": "Simpler models like Q-learning with linear approximation are more suitable for the executor's capabilities and may yield better results with parameter tuning.",
  "reasoning": "The attempts with complex models like TD3, CNN, and transformers all yielded the same score, suggesting that they might be too complex for the executor to implement effectively. The Q-learning approach with linear approximation also resulted in the same score, indicating that it might be a viable path but needs further refinement. Given the constraints and past results, focusing on a simpler model like Q-learning with linear approximation and fine-tuning its parameters could lead to improvements. We should explore this approach further, as it aligns with the executor's capabilities.",
