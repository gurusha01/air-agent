Use the following settings:\n- Learning rate (alpha): 0.1\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Exploration rate (epsilon): 0.1\n- Number of episodes: 2000\n- Use a simple linear function approximation for the Q-value function.\n- Implement epsilon-greedy policy for action selection.\n- Update the epsilon value to decay over time (e.g., epsilon = max(0.01, epsilon * 0.995)).",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the epsilon-greedy policy is correctly implemented to balance exploration and exploitation. If you encounter issues with the learning rate or convergence, consider adjusting the alpha value slightly. Keep the code simple and ensure all necessary imports are included.",

  "memory_update": "Q-learning with linear approximation is the most promising approach so far, and refining hyperparameters could yield further improvements.",
  "reasoning": "The best-performing nodes so far have used Q-learning with linear approximation, achieving a score of 49.7180. Attempts to use SARSA and REINFORCE algorithms have not been successful, with SARSA performing worse than the baseline and REINFORCE failing to execute. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to focus on refining the Q-learning approach, which has shown promise. We should explore variations in hyperparameters or small modifications to the Q-learning setup to potentially improve the score further.",
