Use the following settings:\n- Learning rate (alpha): 0.1\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Exploration strategy: epsilon-greedy with epsilon starting at 0.1 and decaying to 0.01\n- Number of episodes: 5000\n- Use a simple linear function approximator for the Q-value function\n- Update the Q-value function using the Bellman equation",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the epsilon decay is implemented correctly to balance exploration and exploitation. If you encounter issues with the learning rate, try adjusting it slightly (e.g., to 0.05 or 0.2) to see if it impacts performance. Avoid complex neural network implementations.",

  "memory_update": "Q-learning with linear approximation is the most promising approach for this task, and tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and exploration strategy can lead to further improvements.",
  "reasoning": "The Q-learning algorithm with linear approximation has consistently provided the best results so far. However, there is room for improvement through hyperparameter tuning. The SARSA approach did not perform well, and the REINFORCE algorithm failed due to errors. Given our limited node budget, we should focus on refining the Q-learning approach with small hyperparameter tweaks to maximize performance.",
