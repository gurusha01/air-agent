  "reasoning": "The previous attempts using complex models like TD3, CNN, and transformers all resulted in the same score improvement, suggesting that the executor may have reached a complexity limit. The Q-learning approach with linear approximation also yielded the same score, indicating that it might be a suitable model for this environment. Given the executor's limitations, it would be wise to refine the Q-learning approach with small tweaks to hyperparameters or preprocessing steps. This could potentially lead to better performance without overwhelming the executor.",
