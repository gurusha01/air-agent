  "direction": "Implement a Q-learning algorithm using a linear approximation for the Mountain Car Continuous environment. Use the following settings:\n- Discretize the state space into a grid with 10 bins for position and 10 bins for velocity.\n- Use an epsilon-greedy policy with epsilon=0.1 for exploration.\n- Set learning rate (alpha) to 0.1 and discount factor (gamma) to 0.99.\n- Train for 1000 episodes.\n- Use a simple linear function approximation for the Q-value updates.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the state space is discretized properly before applying the Q-learning updates. Avoid complex neural network architectures and stick to a simple linear function approximation. If you encounter issues with state representation, double-check the discretization logic.",

  "memory_update": "Simpler models like Q-learning with linear approximation might be more suitable for the executor's capabilities in this environment.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts using complex models like TD3, CNN, and transformers have achieved a score of 49.7180, which is better than the baseline but might be too complex for the executor to handle efficiently. Given the executor's strengths, we should aim for a simpler approach that leverages models it can handle well, such as those from sklearn or LightGBM. Let's try a simple reinforcement learning approach using a model that the executor can implement, like a basic Q-learning algorithm with a linear approximation.",
