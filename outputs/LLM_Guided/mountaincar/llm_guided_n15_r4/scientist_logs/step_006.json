Use the following settings:\n- Learning rate (alpha): 0.1\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Exploration strategy: epsilon-greedy with epsilon=0.1\n- Number of episodes: 1000\n- Use a simple linear function approximator for the action-value function.",

  "memory_update": "Simpler models like SARSA with linear approximation might provide a slight variation in performance compared to Q-learning in this environment.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts with complex models like TD3, CNN, and transformers did not yield better results than the simpler Q-learning approach. This suggests that the executor performs better with simpler models. The Q-learning approach with linear approximation has shown consistent results, and we should focus on refining this method. Since all variations of Q-learning have yielded the same score, it might be beneficial to try a different simple model that the executor can handle, such as a basic SARSA algorithm, which is closely related to Q-learning but might offer a slight variation in performance.",
