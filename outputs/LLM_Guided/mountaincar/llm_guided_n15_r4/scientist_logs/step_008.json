  "direction": "Implement a basic REINFORCE algorithm for the Mountain Car Continuous environment. Use the following settings:\n- Policy network: A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of 24 neurons and ReLU activation.\n- Learning rate: 0.01\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Use the Adam optimizer for training the policy network.\n- Train for 1000 episodes and average the reward over the last 100 episodes to evaluate performance.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the policy network is simple and does not exceed one hidden layer. If you encounter issues with the optimizer, verify that the learning rate is correctly set. Avoid using complex architectures or additional layers.",
  "mode": "explore",
  "memory_update": "Exploring a basic policy gradient method like REINFORCE could provide a new perspective on solving the Mountain Car Continuous environment within the executor's capabilities.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts with Q-learning and SARSA using linear approximations have shown mixed results, with some improvements over the baseline but not consistently outperforming it. The best scores were achieved with a TD3 agent and a CNN, both of which are too complex for the executor to handle reliably. Given the constraints, it's best to focus on simpler models that the executor can implement effectively. Since Q-learning with linear approximation has shown potential, we should explore a different model family that is still simple and within the executor's capabilities, such as a basic policy gradient method.",
