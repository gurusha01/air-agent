Use a simple linear function approximator for the Q-values. If you encounter convergence issues, try reducing the learning rate to 0.05.",

  "reasoning": "The attempts with Q-learning and SARSA using linear approximation have shown some promise, but the SARSA implementation resulted in a negative score, indicating it might not be suitable without further tuning. The Q-learning approach, however, achieved a score of 49.7180, which is significantly better than the baseline. Given the remaining budget, it would be prudent to refine the Q-learning approach further, possibly by tweaking hyperparameters or simplifying the implementation to ensure stability and performance.",
