  "direction": "Implement a Q-learning algorithm using a linear approximation for the Mountain Car Continuous environment. Use the following settings:\n- Learning rate (alpha): 0.1\n- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99\n- Exploration rate (epsilon): start at 0.1 and decay over time\n- Number of episodes: 5000\n- Feature representation: Use a simple tile coding approach to discretize the state space\n- Update rule: Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a))",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the state space is discretized effectively using tile coding to improve the approximation. Avoid using complex feature engineering techniques, as they may not be suitable for the executor's capabilities. If you encounter issues with the learning rate or convergence, consider adjusting the alpha or gamma values slightly.",

  "memory_update": "Q-learning with linear approximation is a viable approach for the Mountain Car Continuous environment, and further hyperparameter tuning could enhance performance.",
  "reasoning": "The Q-learning with linear approximation approach has shown consistent results, achieving a score of 49.7180. This suggests that the executor can handle this model well. However, attempts to implement SARSA and REINFORCE have not been successful, with SARSA performing poorly and REINFORCE failing due to errors. Given the remaining nodes, it's prudent to refine the Q-learning approach further by tuning hyperparameters to potentially improve performance.",
