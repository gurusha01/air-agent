Use the existing sparse reward based on the car's position relative to the hilltop, and add a velocity-based reward. Ensure the reward is only positive when the car's velocity is directed towards the goal. Implement this in a single Python script, keeping it under 100 lines.",

  "reasoning": "The approach in Node root_1, which applied a sparse reward shaping technique, significantly improved the score over the baseline. This suggests that reward shaping is a promising direction. Node root_2, which introduced a physics-based state encoding, also improved the score but to a lesser extent. The failure in Node root_0 was due to an overly complex approach involving a neural network, which is not suitable for the executor's capabilities. Given the limited nodes left, we should focus on refining the successful reward shaping approach from Node root_1 to further improve the score.",
