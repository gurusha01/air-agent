  "reasoning": "The reward shaping approach in node root_1 significantly improved performance, achieving a score of 68.8956. However, further refinement in node root_1_0 led to a drastic decrease in performance. This suggests that the initial reward shaping was beneficial, but the subsequent changes were detrimental. The Fourier feature map approach in node root_2 showed a slight improvement over the baseline, indicating potential but not as effective as reward shaping. Given that we have only one node left, we should focus on refining the successful reward shaping technique from node root_1 with a small, concrete variation to avoid the pitfalls encountered in node root_1_0.",
