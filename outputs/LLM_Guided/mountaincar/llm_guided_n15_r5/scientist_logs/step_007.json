LightGBM did not perform as well, and the attempt to use a Gaussian process regression-based approach failed. Therefore, focusing on refining the XGBoost model seems promising. Since we have a limited number of nodes left, it's prudent to exploit the best-performing node with further hyperparameter tuning.",
