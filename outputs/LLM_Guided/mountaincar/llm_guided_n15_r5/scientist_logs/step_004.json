Set up the environment using LightGBM's LGBMRegressor with these hyperparameters: n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=7, num_leaves=31. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and apply standard scaling to all features. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, use LightGBM's native handling of categorical features by specifying them in the cat_feature parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, ensure all categorical features are cast to strings.",

The XGBoost approach showed some promise with a score of 37.3726, which is better than the baseline. Given the executor's strengths, it's wise to further explore tree-based models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost with different hyperparameters or preprocessing techniques. We have not yet tried LightGBM or CatBoost, which are within the executor's capabilities and might yield better results.",
