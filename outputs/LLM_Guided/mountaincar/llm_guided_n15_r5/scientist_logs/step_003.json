Set up the environment using XGBoost's XGBRegressor with these hyperparameters: n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=6, and subsample=0.8. For preprocessing, standardize the features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Ensure the reward is maximized by tuning the model's hyperparameters if needed. Evaluate the model by calculating the mean reward over multiple episodes.",

  "reasoning": "The two successful nodes both achieved a score of 49.7180, which is a significant improvement over the baseline. These nodes involved complex neural network architectures. However, our executor is better suited for simpler models like those from sklearn, XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost. The failed node attempted a Gaussian process regression-based approach, which did not succeed due to a likely implementation complexity or evaluation script issue. Given the executor's strengths, we should try a new model family that aligns with its capabilities. Let's explore a simpler model like XGBoost, which is often effective for RL tasks.",
