  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model has shown promise with a significant improvement over the baseline score. The best score achieved so far is 54.7507 using XGBoost with specific hyperparameters. Given the limited number of nodes left, it's prudent to refine the XGBoost model further to see if we can achieve even better results. The previous attempt with n_estimators=300 and learning_rate=0.1 was successful, so we should try a slight variation in hyperparameters to optimize performance further.",
