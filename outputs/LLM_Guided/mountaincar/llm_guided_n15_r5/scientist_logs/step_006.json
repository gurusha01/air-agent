  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model showed potential with a score improvement over the baseline. The previous attempt with XGBoost achieved a score of 37.3726, which is better than the baseline. However, the subsequent attempt with different hyperparameters resulted in a lower score. This indicates that hyperparameter tuning is crucial for improving performance. Since LightGBM did not perform as well, it might be beneficial to refine the XGBoost model further. We have not yet tried CatBoost, which could be another promising model family to explore.",
