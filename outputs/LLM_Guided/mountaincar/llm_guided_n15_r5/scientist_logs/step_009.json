  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model has shown promise, particularly with the hyperparameters in node root_3_1, which achieved a score of 54.7507. However, subsequent attempts to refine these hyperparameters resulted in worse scores. Given that we have 6 nodes remaining, we should focus on further refining the XGBoost model to see if we can improve the score. Additionally, since LightGBM did not perform well, we should avoid it for now. Instead, let's try CatBoost, which hasn't been explored yet and could potentially yield better results.",
