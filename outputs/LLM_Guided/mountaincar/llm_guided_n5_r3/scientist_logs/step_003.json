  "reasoning": "The Gaussian Process-based policy model in node root_2 achieved a significantly better score than the baseline, indicating that probabilistic models might be effective for this task. The previous failures in nodes root_0 and root_1 suggest that complex architectures and feature engineering pipelines were too ambitious for the executor. Given the limited nodes remaining, it is prudent to refine the successful approach from node root_2 by tweaking hyperparameters or adding simple preprocessing steps to further improve the performance.",
