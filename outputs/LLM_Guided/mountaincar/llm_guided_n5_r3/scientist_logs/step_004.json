  "reasoning": "The Gaussian Process-based policy model with a probabilistic surrogate has shown significant improvement over the baseline. However, the attempt to refine it with a Radial Basis Function kernel did not yield further improvements. Given that we have only one node left, it is prudent to refine the existing successful approach rather than trying a completely new model. We should focus on tuning hyperparameters of the Gaussian Process model to potentially enhance its performance.",
