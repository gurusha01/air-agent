Ensure all features are numeric before training the model. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. Evaluate the model using the score metric provided.\n\n(VS suggestion: Apply a reinforcement learning strategy where the row player updates their choice probability based on past outcomes using a simple Q-learning update rule. The initial probability of choosing \"Movie\" is set to 0.5, and after each round, the probability is adjusted by a learning rate of 0.1 toward the action that yielded a higher payoff. The current probability is dynamically updated using observed opponent responses, with a focus on exploiting patterns in opponent behavior over 5 consecutive rounds.)",
