Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. Train the model on the training data and evaluate it on the test data. Report the accuracy score.\n\n(VS suggestion: Apply a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player adapts their choice based on observed opponent behavior over time, updating probabilities using a simple Q-learning algorithm with a learning rate of 0.1 and discount factor of 0.9. The initial strategy is uniform (0.5, 0.5), and after each round, the payoff for each action is updated based on actual outcomes, leading to convergence toward a strategy that maximizes long-term average payoff.)",
