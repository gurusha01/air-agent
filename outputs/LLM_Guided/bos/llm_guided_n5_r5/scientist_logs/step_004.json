The attempt using Logistic Regression (node root_3) came close to the baseline but still fell short. Since the executor performs well with simple sklearn models, I will refine the Logistic Regression approach by introducing a different model family that the executor can handle well, such as XGBoost, which often performs better with default settings on a variety of datasets.",
