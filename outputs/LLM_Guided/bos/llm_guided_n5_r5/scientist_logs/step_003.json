  "reasoning": "The previous attempts using mixed strategies and dynamic strategies didn't perform well, scoring lower than the baseline. The executor is likely struggling with the complexity of implementing these strategies. We need to simplify our approach and focus on a straightforward model that the executor can handle well. Since we haven't tried a machine learning model yet, let's explore using a simple, well-known model like Logistic Regression, which is suitable for binary classification tasks and should be straightforward for the executor to implement.",
