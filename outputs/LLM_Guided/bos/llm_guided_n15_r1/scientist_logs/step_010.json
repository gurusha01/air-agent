Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and using the `cat_features` parameter in CatBoost to handle categorical columns. Ensure that all categorical columns are cast to string type before fitting the model. Use a sliding window of past moves as features to predict the opponent's next move.",

  "reasoning": "The LightGBM classifier with specific hyperparameters has shown promise, achieving a score of 1.0338. However, further tuning in the last attempt slightly decreased the score. Given the remaining nodes, it would be prudent to explore a different model family to see if we can achieve a better score. CatBoost is a good candidate due to its handling of categorical features and its potential for high accuracy. We haven't tried CatBoost yet, so it will add diversity to our approach.",
