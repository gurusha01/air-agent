Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and using the 'cat_features' parameter to handle categorical columns directly. Ensure that all categorical columns are cast to string before passing them to the model. This should be implementable in under 100 lines of Python.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to cast all categorical columns to strings before passing them to CatBoost to avoid dtype errors. Do not use get_dummies, as CatBoost can handle categorical features natively with the 'cat_features' parameter.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's potential for handling categorical data efficiently remains unexplored and could offer improvements over LightGBM with the right hyperparameters.",
  "reasoning": "The LightGBM classifier has shown consistent improvement with careful hyperparameter tuning, reaching a score of 1.0338. However, further tuning attempts have resulted in diminishing returns. CatBoost has not been fully explored yet, and given its efficient handling of categorical data, it might offer improvements. The previous attempt with CatBoost was not optimal, as it scored lower than the baseline. We should explore CatBoost again with different hyperparameters to see if it can outperform LightGBM.",
