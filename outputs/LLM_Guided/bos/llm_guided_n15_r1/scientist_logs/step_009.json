  "reasoning": "The LightGBM classifier with specific hyperparameters has shown incremental improvements in score, indicating potential in refining this approach. The best score achieved so far is 1.0338 using LightGBM with specific hyperparameters. Given the limited number of nodes left, it is prudent to focus on exploiting this approach further by fine-tuning the hyperparameters to see if we can achieve a higher score. Since LightGBM has been the most promising, we should continue refining it with slight variations in hyperparameters.",
