Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder and filling any missing values with the mode of the column.

Adjust the row player's strategy based on the predicted move.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far is root_1, which implements a payoff-based adaptive strategy. This suggests that strategies which adapt based on previous outcomes are promising. The other nodes either performed worse or were too simplistic. To improve upon the current best score, we should refine the adaptive strategy by introducing a simple machine learning model that can learn from historical data to predict the opponent's next move. A logistic regression model could be a good fit, as it is simple and interpretable.",
