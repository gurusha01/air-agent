  "reasoning": "The adaptive strategy in node root_1 showed promise with a score of 1.0942, indicating that learning from past outcomes can be effective. However, attempts to use logistic regression and XGBoost in nodes root_1_0 and root_1_1 did not improve the score, likely due to suboptimal feature representation or model choice. Given the success of adaptive strategies, it would be beneficial to explore another model that can handle time-series-like data effectively. LightGBM is a good candidate as it can handle categorical features and is efficient with large datasets.",
