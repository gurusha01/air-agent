Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

If you encounter a dtype error, ensure all categorical features are cast to strings before encoding.",

  "reasoning": "The best score so far was achieved with an adaptive strategy that learns from past outcomes (Node root_1). This indicates that strategies incorporating historical data can be effective. However, the logistic regression model in Node root_1_0 underperformed, possibly due to inadequate feature representation or model complexity. We should explore another model that can handle temporal data well, such as a time series model or a decision tree-based model like XGBoost, which can capture non-linear patterns. Given our budget, we can afford to try a new model family and refine our best approach.",
