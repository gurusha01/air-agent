Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and using LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by specifying the `categorical_feature` parameter. Ensure all categorical features are correctly identified and passed to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that all categorical features are correctly identified and passed to the LightGBM model using the `categorical_feature` parameter. Avoid using get_dummies as LightGBM handles categorical features natively, which is more efficient. Make sure to fill any missing numeric values with the median to avoid errors during training.",

  "memory_update": "LightGBM's performance can be further improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters, indicating its potential for adaptive strategies in game theory tasks.",
  "reasoning": "The LightGBM classifier has shown promise, with incremental improvements through hyperparameter tuning. The node root_1_2_0_0_0 achieved the highest score so far with specific LightGBM settings. Given the limited nodes remaining, it is prudent to refine this approach further with slight hyperparameter adjustments to potentially improve the score. CatBoost was attempted but did not yield a competitive score, so focusing on LightGBM seems more promising.",
