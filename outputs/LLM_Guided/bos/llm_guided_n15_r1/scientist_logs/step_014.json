Ensure all categorical variables are cast to strings before training.",

  "reasoning": "The LightGBM approach has shown promise, achieving the highest score so far. The last attempt with a LightGBM classifier and specific hyperparameters (num_leaves=40, learning_rate=0.03, n_estimators=150) resulted in a score of 1.0338. Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters could potentially yield even better results. Since we only have one node remaining, it is prudent to exploit the best-performing approach by making small adjustments to hyperparameters.",
