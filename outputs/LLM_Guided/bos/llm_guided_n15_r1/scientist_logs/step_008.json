Ensure all categorical features are cast to string type before fitting the model.",

  "reasoning": "The LightGBM classifier with specific hyperparameters (num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=100) has shown the best performance so far with a score of 1.0304. This suggests that LightGBM is a promising model for this task. To further improve the score, we should continue refining the LightGBM approach by experimenting with different hyperparameters. Given the limited nodes remaining, it is prudent to exploit this promising approach.",
