This suggests that LightGBM's handling of categorical data and efficiency might be beneficial. However, the score is still below the baseline, indicating room for improvement. Given that adaptive strategies using historical data show promise, we should refine the LightGBM approach with specific hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve its performance.",
