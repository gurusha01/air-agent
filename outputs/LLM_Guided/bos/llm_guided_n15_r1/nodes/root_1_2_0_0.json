  "strategy": "Use a LightGBM classifier with the following settings: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=100. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and encoding categorical features using LightGBM's cat_features parameter. Use a sliding window of past moves as features. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to string before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the number of estimators from 100 to 150 to improve model stability and allow more exposure to opponent patterns during training. This increase in iterations can help the model better capture long-term dependencies in move sequences without altering the learning rate or preprocessing pipeline. The rest of the hyperparameters remain unchanged: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05. This variation maintains the core structure of the original approach while providing more training iterations to refine predictions, potentially leading to better average payoff.)",
