  "strategy": "Use a LightGBM classifier with the following settings: num_leaves=50, learning_rate=0.01, n_estimators=250. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and using LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by specifying the `categorical_feature` parameter. Ensure all categorical features are correctly identified and passed to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the number of estimators from 150 to 160, while keeping num_leaves=40, learning_rate=0.03, and maintaining the same preprocessing pipeline (median imputation for numeric NaNs, categorical features cast to string and handled via LightGBM's native categorical encoding). This small increase in training iterations allows the model to refine its predictions on earlier rounds of interaction, potentially capturing more subtle temporal patterns in opponent behavior without introducing significant overfitting risk. The incremental step from 150 to 160 is safer than jumping to 200 and provides a balanced exploration of convergence and learning depth.)",
