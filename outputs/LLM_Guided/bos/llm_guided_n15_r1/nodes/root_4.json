Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and using the 'cat_features' parameter to handle categorical columns directly. Ensure that all categorical columns are cast to string before passing them to the model. This should be implementable in under 100 lines of Python.\n\n(VS suggestion: Employ a reinforcement learning-inspired strategy where the row player updates their choice based on a reward signal derived from the opponent's past actions. Specifically, if the opponent chose \"Movie\" in the previous round, the row player selects \"Game\" with probability 0.7, otherwise selects \"Movie\" with probability 0.7. This creates a dynamic feedback loop that exploits patterns in opponent behavior without explicit modeling of payoff matrices.)",
