  "strategy": "Use a LightGBM classifier to predict the opponent's next move based on a sliding window of past moves. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and label encoding categorical features. Use these exact hyperparameters for LightGBM: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=100. Ensure to handle categorical features using LightGBM's native support by specifying the `categorical_feature` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before label encoding.\n\n(VS suggestion: The current LightGBM model uses a fixed learning rate of 0.05. To improve convergence and responsiveness to opponent patterns, I propose increasing the learning rate to 0.1 while keeping all other hyperparameters the same (num_leaves=31, n_estimators=100). This adjustment allows the model to adapt more quickly to shifts in opponent behavior, potentially capturing subtle patterns in move sequences that the current model misses. The preprocessing pipeline remains unchanged: numeric NaN values are filled with median, and categorical features are encoded using LabelEncoder after being cast to strings. This variation maintains the core structure of the approach while enhancing training dynamics.)",
