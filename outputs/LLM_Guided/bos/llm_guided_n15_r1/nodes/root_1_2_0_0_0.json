  "strategy": "Use a LightGBM classifier with the following settings: num_leaves=40, learning_rate=0.03, n_estimators=150. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and encoding categorical features using LightGBM's native categorical handling by passing the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical features are cast to string type before fitting the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the number of estimators from 100 to 120, while keeping all other hyperparameters the same (num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05). This incremental increase in training iterations provides a balance between model stability and exposure to opponent patterns, offering more opportunities for the model to learn subtle temporal dynamics in move sequences without overfitting. The smaller step from 100 to 120 reduces risk compared to jumping to 150, and may lead to a more stable improvement in average payoff due to better convergence in the early training phases.)",
