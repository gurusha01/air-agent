  "strategy": "Use a LightGBM classifier with the following settings: num_leaves=45, learning_rate=0.02, n_estimators=200. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median and using LabelEncoder for categorical features. Ensure to pass the categorical feature indices to LightGBM using the 'categorical_feature' parameter. If you encounter any dtype errors, explicitly cast categorical columns to strings before encoding.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the learning rate from 0.03 to 0.04 while keeping num_leaves=40 and n_estimators=150. This slight increase in learning rate can improve the model's responsiveness to pattern shifts in opponent behavior, allowing it to adapt more quickly to temporal dynamics in move sequences. The change is incremental and maintains the existing preprocessing pipeline, ensuring consistency with the baseline methodology.)",
