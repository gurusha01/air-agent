  "strategy": "Implement a context-aware strategy that uses historical opponent behavior patterns to predict column player preferences. The row player observes past rounds and assigns a weighted probability to each action based on whether the column player previously chose Action A or Action B. If the column player has chosen Action A in more than 60% of the last 5 rounds, the row player chooses Action B with probability 0.7; otherwise, they choose Action A with probability 0.7. This leverages sequential pattern recognition using a simple moving average filter to detect shifts in opponent behavior.",
