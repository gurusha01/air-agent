  "reasoning": "Node root_2 achieved the highest score of 1.3275 using a stochastic time-series forecasting model. This suggests that leveraging past outcomes to predict future choices is a promising strategy. We should refine this approach with slight modifications to potentially improve the score further. Since we have limited nodes left, it's crucial to focus on exploiting this successful strategy rather than exploring entirely new approaches.",
