This approach leverages past outcomes to predict the column player's choice, achieving a score of 1.3275. The subsequent attempt to refine this model (root_2_0) resulted in a slightly lower score of 1.2908, indicating that the specific hyperparameter changes made were not beneficial. Given that we have only one node remaining, we should focus on refining the best-performing approach with minor adjustments to potentially improve the score further.",
