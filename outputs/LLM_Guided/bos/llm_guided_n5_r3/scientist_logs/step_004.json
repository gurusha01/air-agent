Use an epsilon-greedy approach with epsilon starting at 0.1 and decaying by 0.01 every 10 rounds until it reaches a minimum of 0.01. This will allow exploration while gradually favoring exploitation of the best-known strategy. Ensure to track and update the success rate of each action to inform probability updates.",

  "reasoning": "The reinforcement-learning-inspired strategy in node root_2 has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 1.3990. This suggests that adaptive probability updates based on historical data are effective for this task. The slight decrease in score in node root_2_0 indicates that the variation attempted there did not improve the performance. Given that we have only one node remaining, it is prudent to focus on refining the best-performing approach with a small tweak to potentially enhance the score further.",
