  "direction": "Use a reinforcement-learning-inspired strategy where the row player updates their action probability based on historical outcomes. Adjust the learning rate to 0.1 and introduce a decay factor of 0.99 to gradually reduce the influence of older outcomes. Implement this with a simple Python script that updates probabilities after each round based on the outcome. Ensure the script is concise and under 100 lines.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle any potential division by zero errors when updating probabilities. If you encounter an error related to probability updates, check that all probabilities are normalized and sum to 1. Do not attempt complex feature engineering or multi-step processes.",

  "memory_update": "Reinforcement-learning-inspired strategies with adaptive probability updates are effective in this task.",
  "reasoning": "The reinforcement-learning-inspired strategy in node root_2 achieved the highest score of 1.3990, indicating that adaptive strategies based on historical data are effective. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, we should focus on refining this approach with small, concrete variations to potentially increase the score further. Since the executor has been successful with this strategy, we should exploit this node by making minor adjustments to the hyperparameters or strategy details.",
