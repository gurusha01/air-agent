This introduces dynamic behavioral shifts that exploit potential patterns in the column player\u2019s response over time. For instance, the strategy alternates with a 50% chance of cooperation in even rounds and 70% in odd rounds, creating a non-stationary signal that may force the column player into suboptimal responses.",
