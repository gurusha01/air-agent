  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement-learning-inspired strategy where the row player updates their action probability based on historical outcomes. Use an epsilon-greedy approach with epsilon starting at 0.1 and decaying by 0.01 every 10 rounds until it reaches a minimum of 0.01. This will allow exploration while gradually favoring exploitation of the best-known strategy. Ensure to track and update the success rate of each action to inform probability updates.\n\n(VS suggestion: Modify the epsilon-greedy exploration rate decay to follow a logarithmic decay instead of linear, starting from 0.1 and decreasing as the number of interactions grows. This allows for more sustained exploration in early rounds while enabling faster convergence to high-payoff actions later, preserving the balance between exploitation and exploration without over-exploring early. The decay function is defined as epsilon = 0.1 * (1 / (1 + log(t + 1))) where t is the interaction count.)",
