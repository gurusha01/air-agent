This increases the model's capacity to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data while maintaining stability through a slightly higher learning rate. For preprocessing, maintain the median imputation of numeric NaNs and LabelEncoder on categorical features, but now apply a one-hot encoding step *only* to categorical features with more than 5 unique categories to avoid overfitting from sparse features. If dtype errors occur, ensure all categorical columns are cast to strings before encoding. This variation enhances feature representation without introducing unpredictability.)",
