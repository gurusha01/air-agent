For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LabelEncoder for categorical columns. Ensure all features are numeric before fitting the model. If you encounter any dtype errors, cast categorical features to strings before encoding.\n\n(VS suggestion: Employ a quantum-inspired probabilistic strategy where the row player's action selection is governed by a non-linear feedback loop derived from the cosine of the time delay between previous moves. Specifically, if the column player's action was 'A' in the last round, the row player selects 'A' with probability 0.75 and 'B' with 0.25; if the column player chose 'B', the row player selects 'A' with probability 0.25 and 'B' with 0.75. This strategy introduces a phase-shifted anticipation mechanism based on trigonometric mapping of temporal dynamics.)",
