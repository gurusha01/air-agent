  "reasoning": "The previous attempts using simple strategies and basic models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees have not outperformed the baseline. The Logistic Regression model was the closest but still underperformed. Given the constraints and the executor's capabilities, it would be beneficial to try a different model family that is simple yet powerful, such as XGBoost, which can handle both linear and non-linear patterns effectively. This approach will allow us to explore a new model family while keeping the implementation straightforward.",
