For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median of the column, and use LabelEncoder for categorical columns. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set. Report the score based on the model's predictions.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle NaN values before encoding categorical columns. Do not use get_dummies as it may cause memory issues; instead, use LabelEncoder for categorical features. Ensure that the data is split correctly into training and testing sets before training the model.",

  "memory_update": "Consider exploring simple ML models like Logistic Regression to see if they can outperform the baseline in the game theory task.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts focused on implementing various strategies for the game theory problem, but they all performed worse than the baseline. The best score was achieved by Node root_1, which used a dynamic adaptive strategy. However, it still underperformed compared to the baseline. Since we have not yet tried any machine learning models, it would be beneficial to explore a simple model to see if it can outperform the baseline. Given the executor's strengths, a straightforward model like Logistic Regression from sklearn could be a good starting point. This will allow us to test if a basic ML approach can improve the score.",
