  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model has shown the best performance so far, with a score of 1.0754. This suggests that tree-based models are effective for this task. However, the variations attempted (nodes root_5_0 and root_5_1) did not improve the score significantly. To further exploit the potential of XGBoost, we can try a slightly different set of hyperparameters to see if we can achieve a better score. Additionally, since we have a few nodes left, we can afford to refine this approach further.",
