For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use `get_dummies` for categorical columns; instead, use the `cat_features` parameter in XGBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",

  "memory_update": "XGBoost with a slightly increased `max_depth` and fine-tuned `learning_rate` may further improve performance.",
  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model has consistently performed well, with node root_5_5 achieving the highest score of 1.0795. This suggests that further tuning of XGBoost hyperparameters could yield even better results. We have already tried various combinations of `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, and `max_depth`. To continue exploiting this approach, we can try a slightly higher `max_depth` and adjust the `learning_rate` to see if it improves the score further.",
