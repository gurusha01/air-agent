If you encounter dtype errors, ensure all categorical features are cast to strings.",

  "memory_update": "Fine-tuning the learning rate and max depth in XGBoost continues to improve performance, suggesting these hyperparameters are key to optimizing the model for this task.",
  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model with hyperparameter tuning has consistently shown the best performance, with the highest score achieved using `n_estimators=160`, `learning_rate=0.04`, and `max_depth=5`. The slight improvement in score suggests that further fine-tuning of the learning rate and max depth could yield even better results. Since we only have one node left, we should focus on exploiting the best-performing approach by making a small adjustment to the hyperparameters.",
