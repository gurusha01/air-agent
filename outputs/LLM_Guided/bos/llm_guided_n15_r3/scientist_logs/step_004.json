  "reasoning": "The previous attempts using mixed strategies and dynamic strategies did not outperform the baseline. The attempt with Logistic Regression also underperformed, likely due to inadequate preprocessing or hyperparameter settings. To explore a different model family, we can try using a simple decision tree classifier, which might capture non-linear patterns better than logistic regression. This will help us diversify our approach while keeping it simple and within the executor's capabilities.",
