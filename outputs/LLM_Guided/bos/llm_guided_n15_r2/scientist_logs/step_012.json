  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with fine-tuned hyperparameters has consistently shown improvements in performance. The best score was achieved with iterations=900, learning_rate=0.015, and depth=7. However, further increasing iterations and adjusting learning rates have not yielded significant improvements. Given the limited nodes remaining, it is prudent to explore a different model family to see if a new approach can outperform the current best CatBoost setup.",
