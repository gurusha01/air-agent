  "reasoning": "The best score so far was achieved using CatBoost with specific hyperparameters. However, further fine-tuning of CatBoost's iterations and learning rate has shown diminishing returns. Exploring a different model family, like LightGBM, showed promise as it achieved a score close to the best CatBoost model. Given the limited actions remaining, it would be prudent to refine the LightGBM approach to see if it can surpass the current best score.",
