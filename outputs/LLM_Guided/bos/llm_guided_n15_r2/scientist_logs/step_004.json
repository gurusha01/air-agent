  "reasoning": "The payoff-weighted strategy at node root_2 showed a significant improvement over the baseline, suggesting that leveraging payoff information is beneficial. However, the subsequent attempt using LightGBM at root_2_0 did not perform well, indicating that the model choice or its configuration might not be optimal for this task. Given the success of payoff-weighted strategies, we should explore another model that can handle such strategies effectively. CatBoost is known for handling categorical features well and might perform better with the right configuration.",
