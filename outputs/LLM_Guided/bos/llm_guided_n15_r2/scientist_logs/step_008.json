  "reasoning": "The payoff-weighted strategy with CatBoost has shown promising results, with node root_2_1_1_0 achieving the highest score so far. This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features natively is beneficial in this context. Fine-tuning hyperparameters, particularly iterations and learning rate, has been effective. Given the remaining budget, it's prudent to continue refining this approach with slight variations in hyperparameters to further optimize performance.",
