  "reasoning": "The best performing node so far is root_2, which implements a payoff-weighted strategy. This suggests that strategies that incorporate some form of payoff or probability weighting are effective. The other nodes (root_0 and root_1) underperformed, possibly due to their simplistic or arbitrary nature. Given the current budget of 12 nodes, we should explore a new model family while also refining the successful payoff-weighted strategy. Specifically, we can try a LightGBM model with a focus on hyperparameter tuning to see if it can outperform the current best node.",
