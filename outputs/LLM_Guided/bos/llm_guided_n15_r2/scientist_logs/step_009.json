Fine-tuning hyperparameters such as iterations and learning rate has been beneficial. The last attempt with 900 iterations and a learning rate of 0.015 improved the score slightly. Given the limited nodes remaining, it's prudent to continue refining this approach with slight adjustments to hyperparameters to further optimize performance.",
