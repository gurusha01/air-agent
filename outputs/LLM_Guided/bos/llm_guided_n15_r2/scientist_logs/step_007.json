  "reasoning": "The payoff-weighted strategy combined with CatBoost has shown promise, particularly in node root_2_1_1, which achieved a score of 1.3815. This suggests that CatBoost's handling of categorical features and the payoff-weighted strategy are effective. To further exploit this approach, we can try fine-tuning the hyperparameters of CatBoost. Since we have 8 nodes remaining, we can afford to explore a few more hyperparameter variations to see if we can improve the score further.",
