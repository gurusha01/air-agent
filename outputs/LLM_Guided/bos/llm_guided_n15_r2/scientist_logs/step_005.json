This suggests that CatBoost's handling of categorical features is beneficial in this context. However, it didn't surpass the baseline score of 1.3904. We should refine this approach by adjusting hyperparameters or preprocessing steps to see if we can improve the score further. Since we have a reasonable number of nodes left, we can afford to explore a new model family while also refining the best-performing approach.",
