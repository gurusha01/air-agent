For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and apply a logarithmic transformation to numeric features with positive values to reduce skew and improve convergence. Keep the same historical replay window of 5 rounds, but apply a dynamic decay factor of 0.97 instead of 0.95 to recent rounds' payoff contributions, increasing sensitivity to the most recent opponent behavior while maintaining a stable historical estimate. This small adjustment to the decay factor may improve responsiveness without introducing noise.)",
