For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and pass cat_features parameter to CatBoost. Ensure categorical features are cast to string if needed.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the learning rate to 0.020 and increase iterations to 800, while keeping depth at 7. Maintain the same preprocessing pipeline: fill numeric NaN with median, drop columns with >50% missing values, and set cat_features to all categorical columns. Cast categorical columns to string if dtype errors occur. This balances the stability of a higher learning rate with sufficient training epochs to capture nuanced patterns in the payoff predictions, potentially improving average payoff for the row player without overfitting.)",
