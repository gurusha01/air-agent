  "strategy": "Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6, cat_features set to the list of all categorical columns. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass them directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter dtype errors, ensure that all categorical columns are cast to strings.\n\n(VS suggestion: Refine the historical replay window from 5 rounds to 3 rounds to reduce noise and increase responsiveness to recent opponent behavior. This reduces the lag in strategy updates and may better capture short-term patterns that influence payoff differences. The expected payoff difference is still calculated using the same payoff-weighted method, but now based on only the last 3 rounds. The probability of selecting \"High\" is adjusted dynamically using a decay factor of 0.95 on each round's contribution to the historical payoff estimate, giving more weight to recent data. This improves temporal relevance without changing the core payoff-weighted logic.)",
