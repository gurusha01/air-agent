For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with >50% missing values, and set cat_features to all categorical columns. Cast categorical columns to string if dtype errors occur. This balances training stability and model capacity\u2014increasing learning rate slightly enhances gradient updates, while reducing iterations from 900 to 800 may reduce overfitting without sacrificing too much performance, potentially improving generalization in payoff prediction for the row player.)",
