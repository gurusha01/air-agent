For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LabelEncoder for categorical variables. However, apply a post-training feature scaling step using MinMaxScaler only on the numeric features, applied after median imputation but before model training. This can help stabilize gradient updates and improve convergence in the presence of skewed distributions, potentially enhancing the model's sensitivity to payoff patterns in the row player\u2019s strategic choices. All categorical features remain encoded via LabelEncoder before training. If a dtype error occurs, cast categorical columns to strings before encoding.)",
