For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LabelEncoder for categorical variables. Ensure that all categorical features are encoded before training. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before encoding.\n\n(VS suggestion: Switch to a Random Forest model with 500 trees, using mean imputation for numeric NaN values and one-hot encoding for categorical features. Include interaction terms between key features (e.g., strategy combinations) derived from the game dynamics. Apply feature importance pruning to retain only the top 30% of features, reducing noise and improving generalization for the row player's payoff prediction. This approach leverages ensemble stability and explicit modeling of strategic interactions, offering a different pathway than gradient-boosted trees.)",
