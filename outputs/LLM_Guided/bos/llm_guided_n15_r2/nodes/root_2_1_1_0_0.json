For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and pass categorical features using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to strings before training.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the learning rate to 0.025 and increase iterations to 700, keeping depth at 7. Maintain the same preprocessing pipeline: fill numeric NaN with median, drop columns with >50% missing values, and set cat_features to all categorical columns. Cast categorical columns to string if dtype errors occur. This slightly lower learning rate may improve stability during training, allowing for smoother convergence, while the reduced iterations help prevent overfitting, potentially leading to better generalization in the payoff prediction for the row player.)",
