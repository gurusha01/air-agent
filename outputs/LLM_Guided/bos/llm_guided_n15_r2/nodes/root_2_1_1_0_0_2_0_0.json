For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing data. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, use LabelEncoder to encode them.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the LightGBM hyperparameters slightly by increasing the learning rate to 0.03 and reducing max_depth to 6, while keeping num_boost_round=1000 and num_leaves=31. This increases training speed and may improve convergence by reducing overfitting on complex interactions. For preprocessing, maintain median imputation for numeric NaNs and LabelEncoder for categorical variables. However, before encoding, convert all categorical columns to strings explicitly to prevent dtype issues during training. This variation emphasizes stronger regularization via depth reduction and a slightly more aggressive learning rate, which may improve generalization in strategic payoff prediction.)",
