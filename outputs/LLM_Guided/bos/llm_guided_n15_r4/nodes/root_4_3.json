Ensure all categorical variables are cast to strings before fitting the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and additionally apply a robust scaling step (e.g., RobustScaler) to the numeric features before feeding them to the model. This helps reduce the impact of outliers and improves stability in feature distributions, which can lead to more consistent predictions in the Battle of Sexes setting where payoffs are sensitive to small shifts in behavior. Maintain the same categorical preprocessing (cast to strings and pass via `cat_features`).)",
