For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical features to strings before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=550, learning_rate=0.029, depth=7. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and apply a post-fill outlier cap by capping values exceeding 2.5 standard deviations above the median at that threshold. Additionally, introduce a small scaling factor (multiplicative scaling of 1.01) to the numeric features to gently adjust feature magnitudes and improve gradient flow during training, which can help with convergence in noisy datasets. This variation maintains the core preprocessing and model structure while enhancing numerical stability and gradient responsiveness.)",
