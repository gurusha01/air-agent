For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, but instead of dropping columns with more than 50% missing values, retain them and apply a simple imputation-based feature engineering step where missing values are replaced with a weighted average of the non-missing values in the same column (using a 0.5 weight for the median and 0.5 for the mean). This preserves more information while reducing data loss. Additionally, after imputation, apply a simple outlier detection using IQR on numeric features and cap extreme values at 1.5\u00d7IQR to reduce noise in the model\u2019s learning signal.)",
