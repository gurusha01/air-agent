For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before training.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=550, learning_rate=0.029, depth=7. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and apply a post-fill outlier cap by capping values more than 3 standard deviations above the median at 3 standard deviations above the median. Additionally, introduce a small shift in the median fill for skewed distributions by using the median + 0.1% of the range (to gently adjust for bias in extreme tails) without altering the core preprocessing logic. This tweak aims to reduce the influence of extreme outliers while preserving the central tendency, potentially improving model stability and generalization on noisy features.)",
