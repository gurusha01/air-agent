For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.035, depth=6. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, but apply a post-fill outlier cap \u2014 specifically, cap extreme values (more than 3 standard deviations above the median) at 3 standard deviations above the median to reduce noise in the feature space. Additionally, apply a small regularization penalty (use `l2_leaf_reg=3.0`) to improve generalization without overfitting. This variation maintains the core CatBoost framework but introduces mild data cleaning and regularization to stabilize training on noisy or skewed features.)",
