Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical variables to strings.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=550, learning_rate=0.029, depth=7. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and apply a post-fill outlier cap by capping values exceeding 3 standard deviations above the median at that threshold. Additionally, introduce a small feature scaling step using robust scaling (median absolute deviation normalization) to improve convergence and reduce the influence of skewed features, while preserving the original distribution structure. This maintains the core preprocessing and modeling pipeline but enhances stability and sensitivity to subtle feature patterns by normalizing the feature space without distorting the underlying data distribution.)",
