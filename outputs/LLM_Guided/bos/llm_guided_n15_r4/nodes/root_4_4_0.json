For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN with the median, and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before fitting the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Apply a post-fill outlier cap using 2 standard deviations above the median instead of 3, to reduce the impact of extreme outliers while preserving more of the original feature distribution. This is a mild adjustment that maintains the core preprocessing strategy but provides a smoother feature space, potentially improving model stability. Additionally, increase the learning rate slightly to 0.030 to encourage faster convergence, while keeping iterations=550 and depth=7. This variation balances noise reduction with training responsiveness.)",
