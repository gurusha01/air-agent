For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN with the median, and pass categorical features using the cat_features parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before passing to the model. This slight adjustment in hyperparameters aims to explore the potential for further improvement.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the CatBoost hyperparameters to iterations=500, learning_rate=0.035, depth=6. Maintain the same preprocessing pipeline: fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Introduce a slight regularization boost by enabling the `l2_leaf_reg` parameter with a value of 3.0, which may improve generalization by reducing overfitting to noise in the training data without disrupting the model's ability to capture strategic patterns. This small tweak may enhance stability in payoff prediction during repeated interactions.)",
