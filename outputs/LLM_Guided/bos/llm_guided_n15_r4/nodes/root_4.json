For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical features to strings before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Employ a memory-based reinforcement strategy where the row player tracks the opponent's past two moves and adjusts their action probability based on the sequence of previous interactions, favoring coordination if the opponent has consistently chosen the same action in the past two rounds. The strategy uses a sliding window of two actions to compute a weighted payoff expectation, with a penalty for deviation from recent patterns.)",
