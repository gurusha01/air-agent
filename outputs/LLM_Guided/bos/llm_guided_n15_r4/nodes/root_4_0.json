Do NOT use get_dummies for categorical columns \u2014 instead pass cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you get a dtype error, cast categoricals to str first. Additionally, introduce a simple heuristic to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on validation loss improvement.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the CatBoost hyperparameters slightly to improve generalization and stability. Use iterations=600 (increased for better convergence), learning_rate=0.025 (slightly reduced to prevent overfitting), and depth=7 (slightly deeper to capture more complex patterns). Keep preprocessing unchanged: fill numeric NaNs with median and drop columns with >50% missingness. For categorical features, ensure they are cast to strings before feeding into CatBoost to avoid dtype errors. This refinement aims to enhance the model\u2019s ability to learn subtle patterns in opponent behavior without introducing instability.)",
