  "reasoning": "The best performing node so far is root_2, which uses a symmetric correlated equilibrium strategy. This suggests that strategies involving correlation or equilibrium are promising. The CatBoost model in node root_4 also performed well, indicating that it might be beneficial to explore CatBoost further with slight modifications. Since we have 9 nodes left, we can afford to refine the best approaches. Given that dynamic adjustments to correlated equilibria show potential, we should explore a refined strategy that incorporates this with CatBoost.",
