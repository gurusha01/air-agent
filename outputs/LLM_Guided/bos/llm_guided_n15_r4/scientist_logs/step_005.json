  "reasoning": "The node with the highest score so far is root_2, which involves a symmetric correlated equilibrium strategy. This suggests that strategies leveraging correlation or equilibrium concepts are promising. However, the attempt to refine this strategy (root_2_0) resulted in a slight decrease in score. This indicates that while the base strategy is strong, the refinement approach may not have been optimal. Given the budget of 10 nodes remaining, it would be wise to explore a new model family that can potentially leverage the strengths of the correlated equilibrium strategy, such as CatBoost, which handles categorical features well and might improve the model's performance.",
