  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently shown promising results, particularly with fine-tuning of hyperparameters. Node root_4_4 achieved the highest score so far with a slight improvement over the parent node. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to continue refining the CatBoost approach with small adjustments to hyperparameters. Specifically, we can explore a slightly increased depth and adjust the learning rate to see if it yields better results.",
