For example, if the last few rounds resulted in a loss, slightly increase the probability of choosing the alternative action. Implement this adjustment in a loop over multiple iterations to simulate the game. Ensure the code remains under 100 lines.",

  "reasoning": "The symmetric correlated equilibrium strategy in Node root_2 showed a promising improvement over the baseline. This suggests that strategies involving correlation or equilibrium are effective. LightGBM in Node root_3 did not perform well, likely due to suboptimal hyperparameters or preprocessing. To further explore the potential of equilibrium strategies, we can refine the approach in Node root_2 with slight variations to see if we can improve the score further.",
