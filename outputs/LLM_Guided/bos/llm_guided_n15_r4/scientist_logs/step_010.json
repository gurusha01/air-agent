For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values.

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's performance can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the learning rate and depth, indicating the importance of these hyperparameters in this task.",
  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently shown promising results, with node root_4 achieving a score of 1.3749. This indicates that CatBoost is a suitable model for this task. However, further hyperparameter tuning is necessary to improve the score. Previous attempts with different iterations and learning rates have shown minor improvements or declines. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to continue refining the CatBoost model with small adjustments to hyperparameters, specifically focusing on the learning rate and depth, as these have shown potential for improvement.",
