  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameter tuning has shown promising results, consistently outperforming other strategies. The best score so far was achieved with CatBoost using specific settings. Given the remaining budget, it is prudent to refine the CatBoost approach further with slight variations in hyperparameters to see if we can achieve a better score. We have already explored several variations of CatBoost, so we should try one more iteration with a different set of hyperparameters.",
