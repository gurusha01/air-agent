For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by specifying them in the `categorical_feature` parameter. If you encounter any dtype issues, ensure that categorical columns are cast to strings before training.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that categorical features are correctly specified in the `categorical_feature` parameter of LightGBM. Do NOT use get_dummies as LightGBM can handle categorical features natively. If you encounter any errors related to data types, cast categorical columns to strings.",

  "memory_update": "Strategies involving correlation or equilibrium have shown promise; exploring LightGBM could leverage its native handling of categorical features for potential improvement.",
  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far is `root_2`, which applied a symmetric correlated equilibrium strategy. This suggests that strategies involving some form of correlation or equilibrium might be promising. Given the remaining budget, we should explore another model family to ensure diversity while also refining the best approach. Since we haven't tried LightGBM yet, it could be a good candidate to explore. LightGBM is known for its efficiency and accuracy, and it can handle categorical features natively, which might be beneficial for this task.",
