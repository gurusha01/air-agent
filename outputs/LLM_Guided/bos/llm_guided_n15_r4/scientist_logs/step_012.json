For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical features to strings before passing them to the model.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's performance is sensitive to slight adjustments in learning rate and depth, indicating these hyperparameters are crucial for optimizing the model's score.",
  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with slight hyperparameter adjustments has consistently shown promising results, with node root_4_4 achieving the highest score of 1.3775. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to refine this approach further. The learning rate and depth have been identified as crucial hyperparameters, so slight adjustments to these could potentially yield better results. Since the previous attempt with a learning rate of 0.028 and depth of 7 was successful, we can try slightly increasing the iterations and tweaking the learning rate and depth to see if it improves the score.",
