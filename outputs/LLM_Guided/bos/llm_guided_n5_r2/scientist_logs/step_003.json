If the model encounters convergence issues, reduce the MA order to 0 and retry.",

  "reasoning": "The best performing node was root_2, which used a time-series-based forecasting strategy with a simple AR(1) model. This approach improved the score significantly over the baseline. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to refine this successful approach with small adjustments to potentially improve the score further. We should focus on optimizing the AR(1) model by adjusting its parameters or incorporating additional features that could enhance its predictive capability.",
