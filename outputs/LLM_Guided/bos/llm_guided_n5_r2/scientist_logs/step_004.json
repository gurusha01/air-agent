  "reasoning": "The time-series-based forecasting strategy using an AR(1) model with a moving average component has shown the best score so far, indicating that incorporating temporal patterns is beneficial. To further improve the score, we should refine this approach by adding another layer of complexity to the model, such as including an additional lag or a different time-series model that the executor can handle. Since we have only one node left, we should focus on exploiting the best-performing node with a slight variation to maximize our chances of improving the score.",
