  "strategy": "Implement a conditional mixed strategy where the row player chooses action A with probability equal to the square root of the inverse of the column player's action count. Use this formula: `probability_A = sqrt(1 / (1 + column_action_count))`. Ensure that you handle any potential division by zero by adding a small constant (e.g., 1e-6) to the denominator. This should be a simple script under 100 lines.\n\n(VS suggestion: Modify the probability formula by using the natural logarithm of the round number (t) instead of the round number directly, and apply a scaled inverse-log transformation: choose action A with probability 1 / (1 + ln(t + 1)) + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is drawn from a uniform distribution between -0.05 and 0.05. This creates a slower decay than the original approach, as the logarithmic growth of the denominator slows down the decrease in probability, potentially making the strategy less predictable to an opponent who might anticipate a steep drop in action A selection.)",
