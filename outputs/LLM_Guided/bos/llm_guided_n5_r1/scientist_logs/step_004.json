Use this formula: `probability_A = sqrt(1 / (1 + column_action_count))`. Ensure that you handle any potential division by zero by adding a small constant (e.g., 1e-6) to the denominator. This should be a simple script under 100 lines.",

  "reasoning": "The conditional mixed strategy in node `root_1` performed the best so far, achieving a score of 1.1781. This suggests that strategies adapting based on specific conditions are effective. The child node `root_1_0` attempted a logarithmic approach but performed worse, indicating that the specific adaptation method matters. Given that we only have one node left, it is prudent to refine the best-performing strategy rather than trying a completely new approach. We should explore a variation of the conditional strategy, perhaps by adjusting the probability calculation method slightly to see if we can improve the score further.",
