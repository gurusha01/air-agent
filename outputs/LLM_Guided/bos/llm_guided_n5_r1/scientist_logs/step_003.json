Use a logistic regression model to predict the column player's action and adjust the row player's strategy accordingly. Use sklearn's LogisticRegression with the following settings: solver='liblinear', max_iter=200. Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the mean and encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far is root_1, which implemented a conditional mixed strategy. This suggests that strategies that adapt based on some condition or feature of the data may be effective. Given that we have only two nodes left, we should focus on refining this approach to see if we can further improve the score. We should try a variation of this strategy with a different condition or probability function to see if it yields better results.",
