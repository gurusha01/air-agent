For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure you handle NaN values in numeric columns by filling them with the median. Avoid using get_dummies for categorical features, as it can lead to memory issues. Use the cat_features parameter in CatBoost to handle categorical data directly. If you face dtype issues, convert categorical columns to strings.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's native handling of categorical features may simplify preprocessing and improve performance over baseline strategies.",
  "reasoning": "The initial attempts using mixed strategies and adaptive strategies did not improve the baseline score. These approaches might be too complex for the executor to implement effectively. Given the executor's strengths, we should focus on a simpler, more structured approach using a well-known model. CatBoost is a good candidate due to its ability to handle categorical features natively, which simplifies preprocessing. We should attempt a straightforward implementation of CatBoost with specific hyperparameters and minimal preprocessing to see if it improves the score.",
