This suggests that CatBoost's handling of categorical features is effective, but further tuning might be necessary to surpass the baseline. LightGBM also showed potential but didn't outperform CatBoost. Given our remaining budget, we should focus on refining CatBoost further, as it has shown the most promise. We will explore a new variation of CatBoost with slightly adjusted hyperparameters to see if we can improve the score.",
