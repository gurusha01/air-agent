  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameter tuning has shown promising results, getting close to the baseline score. The best score so far was achieved with CatBoost using iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, and depth=6. However, further tuning did not improve the score. LightGBM also showed potential but did not surpass the baseline. Given the remaining budget, it makes sense to try a different model family to see if it can outperform CatBoost. XGBoost is a good candidate as it is similar to LightGBM and CatBoost but may offer different performance characteristics.",
