  "reasoning": "The CatBoost approach in Node root_3 came very close to the baseline score, indicating that CatBoost is a promising model for this task. However, the score was slightly below the baseline. To improve performance, we can try a different model family, such as LightGBM, which is also known for its efficiency and performance with categorical data. Additionally, we should ensure that preprocessing steps are optimized for LightGBM. This exploration will help us understand if LightGBM can outperform CatBoost in this scenario.",
