  "reasoning": "The best performing node so far is `root_3_0_2_2` with a score of 1.0233, which uses CatBoost with specific hyperparameters: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=5, and l2_leaf_reg=2.0. This configuration has surpassed the baseline score. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to refine this approach further to see if we can achieve an even higher score. We should focus on fine-tuning the regularization parameter and possibly the learning rate to see if we can squeeze out more performance.",
