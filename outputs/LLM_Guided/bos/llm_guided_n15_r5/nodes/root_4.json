For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LabelEncoder for categorical features. Ensure that all features are correctly encoded before training. If you encounter any errors related to data types, explicitly cast the data types as needed.\n\n(VS suggestion: Apply a frequency-response strategy where the row player observes the opponent's move history over the last 3 rounds and adjusts their selection probability to match the opponent's most frequent choice, but with a 20% random perturbation to introduce unpredictability. For example, if the opponent has chosen 'Coordination' 70% of the time, the row player selects 'Coordination' with 70% + 20% = 90% probability, otherwise 'Conflict' with 10%. This leverages behavioral patterns while maintaining strategic unpredictability.)",
