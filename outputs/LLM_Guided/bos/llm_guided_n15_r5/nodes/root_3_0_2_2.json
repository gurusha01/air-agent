For preprocessing: maintain median imputation for numeric NaNs and drop columns with >50% missingness. Apply standardization to numeric features with std > 0.1 as before, but introduce a small regularization penalty by applying a 0.01 noise injection during training (via adding Gaussian noise with mean 0 and std 0.01 to the training features before model fitting). This helps improve robustness to overfitting in noisy regions without altering the core structure. Pass categorical features directly via cat_features. If dtype errors occur, cast categorical columns to strings first. This variation maintains the same core pipeline but adds a controlled noise layer to improve generalization in edge cases.)",
