For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LabelEncoder for categorical columns. Ensure to split the data into training and validation sets. Evaluate using the r2 score. If you encounter any dtype errors, cast categorical columns to strings before encoding.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle NaN values appropriately before encoding categorical variables. Do not use get_dummies as it can lead to memory issues; instead, use LabelEncoder. If you encounter dtype issues, ensure all categorical columns are strings before encoding.",

  "memory_update": "LightGBM is a suitable model for this task due to its robustness and compatibility with the executor's capabilities.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts failed due to overly complex approaches and specific errors related to data handling. Node root_0 failed due to a context length issue, likely from trying to implement too complex a solution. Node root_1 encountered a KeyError, possibly due to incorrect column handling. Node root_2 faced a ValueError related to unknown categories, indicating issues with categorical data preprocessing. We need a simpler, more robust approach that the executor can handle effectively. A LightGBM model with straightforward preprocessing should be a good fit, as it is less prone to the issues seen and is within the executor's capabilities.",
