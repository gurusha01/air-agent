For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter any dtype errors, ensure that categorical features are cast to strings.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with categorical feature handling has consistently yielded the best results, with the highest score of 0.9106. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to focus on refining this approach further. The current approach involves using CatBoost with specific hyperparameters and preprocessing steps that have proven effective. To potentially improve the score, we can adjust the hyperparameters slightly, such as increasing the number of iterations and adjusting the learning rate.",
