  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has shown the best performance so far, with a score of 0.9098. This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly is advantageous for this dataset. We should continue to refine the CatBoost model by adjusting its hyperparameters to see if we can achieve even better results. We have not yet tried increasing the depth or the number of iterations significantly, which could potentially improve the model's performance further.",
