  "reasoning": "The best performing node so far is root_0 with a score of 0.8852 using a gradient boosting ensemble approach. However, attempts to refine this using LightGBM have consistently failed due to unseen label errors and dtype issues. The CatBoost attempt failed due to context length issues, but CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly could help avoid the unseen label issues encountered with LightGBM. Given the remaining nodes, we should try a simpler approach with CatBoost, as it can handle categorical features without explicit encoding.",
