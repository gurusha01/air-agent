Preprocess the data by filling numeric NaN values with the median, dropping columns with more than 50% missing values, and encoding categorical features using LabelEncoder. Ensure the target variable is also encoded using LabelEncoder. If you encounter dtype errors, cast categorical features to strings before encoding.",

  "memory_update": "Encoding the target variable and categorical features is crucial to avoid unseen label errors and dtype issues in LightGBM.",
  "reasoning": "The LightGBM approach showed promise with a score of 0.8852, which is better than the baseline. However, it failed due to unseen labels in the target variable and issues with object dtypes in categorical features. To address these, we should encode the target variable using LabelEncoder and ensure categorical features are properly encoded. Given the budget, refining the LightGBM approach with these adjustments is a good next step.",
