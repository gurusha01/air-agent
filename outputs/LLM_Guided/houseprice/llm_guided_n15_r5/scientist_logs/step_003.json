  "reasoning": "The best performing model so far is the gradient boosting ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) with a score of 0.8852. The deep neural network approach failed, likely due to complexity and the executor's limitations. The random forest with permutation importance-based feature selection scored lower than the baseline. Given that we have 12 nodes left, we should explore another model family that the executor can handle well, such as CatBoost, which is known for its performance on structured data. We will also refine the best-performing approach (gradient boosting) by tweaking hyperparameters.",
