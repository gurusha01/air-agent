For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and cast categorical features to strings. Introduce a scaled version of the interquartile range (IQR) of each numeric feature as a new feature during preprocessing, using a scaling factor of 0.05x IQR, to capture robust measures of dispersion without overfitting to noise. This variation leverages IQR, which is less sensitive to outliers than MAD, and may better reflect the underlying distribution of features in housing data.)",
