For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter any dtype errors, ensure that categorical features are cast to strings.\n\n(VS suggestion: Increase the number of iterations to 1200 and slightly increase the learning rate to 0.020 while keeping depth at 8. This allows the model to train longer and potentially capture more subtle patterns in the data, with a small increase in learning rate helping to accelerate convergence without sacrificing stability. Maintain the same preprocessing: fill numeric NaNs with median, drop columns with >50% missingness, and cast categorical features to strings. Additionally, add a scaled version of the median absolute deviation (MAD) of each numeric feature with a scaling factor of 0.15x MAD to enhance robustness to outliers without introducing noise.)",
