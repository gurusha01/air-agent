For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to CatBoost.\n\n(VS suggestion: Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the numeric features to reduce dimensionality and create uncorrelated latent variables, then train a linear regression model on the transformed features. This leverages the inherent redundancy in the feature space and can improve generalization by reducing noise and multicollinearity without introducing non-linearities or complex modeling.)",
