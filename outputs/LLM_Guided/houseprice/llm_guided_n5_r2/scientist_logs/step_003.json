  "reasoning": "The Random Forest ensemble with target encoding (Node root_1) achieved a better score than the baseline, indicating that it is a promising approach. The failed attempt with gradient boosting (Node root_0) encountered a KeyError related to the 'Id' column, suggesting a need for careful handling of dataset columns. The deep neural network (Node root_2) performed poorly, confirming that complex models are not suitable for this task. Given the limited nodes remaining, it is prudent to refine the Random Forest approach with slight modifications to improve the score further.",
