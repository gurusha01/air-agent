For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 40% missing values, and use LightGBM's built-in categorical handling by passing categorical feature indices. If you encounter any dtype errors, convert categorical columns to strings before training.",

  "reasoning": "The best performing node so far is root_4 with a LightGBM model, achieving a score of 0.8894. This indicates that LightGBM with its built-in handling of categorical features is effective for this dataset. Previous attempts to further tune hyperparameters in node root_4's children failed due to execution errors. To improve upon this, we should try a slightly different approach with LightGBM, focusing on a different set of hyperparameters and ensuring robust preprocessing.",
