Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before training to avoid dtype conversion errors.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that all categorical columns are cast to string to prevent dtype conversion errors. Do not use get_dummies; instead, rely on LightGBM's categorical handling.

  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far is `root_4_4` with a score of 0.8913 using LightGBM. The errors in other nodes were primarily due to dtype conversion issues and context length errors. Given the success of LightGBM and the specific hyperparameter tuning, we should continue refining this approach. We have one node remaining, so we should focus on exploiting the best-performing node with a small variation in hyperparameters.",
