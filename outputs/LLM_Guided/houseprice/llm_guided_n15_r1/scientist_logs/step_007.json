For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Use LightGBM's built-in categorical feature handling by passing the `cat_features` parameter. Additionally, create a new feature by calculating the total square footage of the house (sum of all square footage-related features). If you encounter a dtype error, ensure categorical features are cast to strings.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far is root_4, which used LightGBM with specific hyperparameters and preprocessing. The attempts to further tune LightGBM hyperparameters in nodes root_4_0 and root_4_1 failed due to technical issues unrelated to the model's performance. Given the success of LightGBM, we should continue to exploit this approach by refining hyperparameters and ensuring robust preprocessing. We should also consider adding a small amount of feature engineering to potentially boost the score further.",
