  "reasoning": "The best performing approach so far was using LightGBM with specific hyperparameters, achieving a score of 0.8894. This suggests that LightGBM is a promising model for this task. The failures in other nodes were primarily due to data handling issues, such as missing target columns or dtype conversion errors. To improve upon the best score, we can try a small variation in hyperparameters or preprocessing steps. Since LightGBM handles categorical features well, we should leverage this feature. Additionally, we should ensure that the target column is correctly handled to avoid KeyErrors.",
