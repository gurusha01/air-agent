For categorical features, use LightGBM's built-in categorical handling by passing the categorical_feature parameter. Ensure that categorical columns are cast to string type before training. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. Evaluate using the r2 score.",

  "reasoning": "The previous attempts have not been successful in surpassing the baseline score. The failure in Node root_0 was due to a data type conversion issue, likely from categorical features not being handled properly. Node root_1 failed due to a missing target column, indicating a possible issue in data splitting or loading. Node root_2, which used a neural network, performed slightly worse than the baseline, suggesting that the complexity of the model might not be suitable for this task. Given these insights, I will focus on using a simpler model that the executor can handle well, such as LightGBM, with careful handling of categorical data and missing values.",
