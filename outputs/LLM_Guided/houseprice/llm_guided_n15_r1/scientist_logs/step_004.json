  "reasoning": "The previous attempts with complex models and preprocessing steps have failed, often due to errors related to handling categorical data and missing values. The best score so far was achieved with a neural network, but it was still below the baseline. LightGBM has built-in handling for categorical features, which could help avoid dtype conversion errors. We should try a simpler approach with LightGBM, focusing on proper preprocessing and leveraging its capabilities to handle categorical data.",
