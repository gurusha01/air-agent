  "strategy": "Use LightGBM with these settings: num_boost_round=750, learning_rate=0.025, max_depth=7. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and pass categorical features directly to LightGBM using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string type to avoid dtype errors. If you encounter any dtype conversion issues, explicitly cast columns to the appropriate types.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use LightGBM with num_boost_round=650, learning_rate=0.035, max_depth=7 (same as previous approach), but modify preprocessing to fill numeric NaN values with the median for all features except those with skew &lt; 0.3, where we use the mean. This introduces a more conservative use of the mean only for highly symmetric distributions, preserving robustness in skewed features while maintaining sensitivity in low-skew features. This refinement balances stability and model responsiveness without increasing complexity or risk of overfitting.)",
