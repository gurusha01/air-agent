For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's built-in categorical handling by passing the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before training to avoid dtype conversion errors.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use LightGBM with the same settings: num_boost_round=650, learning_rate=0.035, max_depth=7. For preprocessing, maintain the use of median for all numeric features, but add a post-training outlier detection step using IQR to identify and cap extreme values (e.g., cap values beyond Q1 - 1.5*IQR and Q3 + 1.5*IQR) before training. This reduces the influence of extreme outliers that may skew the median-based imputation and improve model stability without altering the core preprocessing logic. The capping is applied only to numeric features and done before training, preserving the original median imputation process. This small but targeted modification improves robustness to extreme values while staying within the established methodology.)",
