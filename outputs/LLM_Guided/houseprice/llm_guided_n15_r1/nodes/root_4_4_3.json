For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's built-in categorical handling by passing categorical features as a parameter. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before passing to the model to avoid dtype errors.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use LightGBM with these settings: num_boost_round=650, learning_rate=0.04, max_depth=7. For preprocessing, maintain the median fill for all numeric features, but apply a post-training feature scaling step (e.g., robust scaling) to normalize the input distribution, especially for high-variance features. This preserves the original median imputation strategy while introducing a small level of feature stabilization, which may help the model converge more smoothly and reduce sensitivity to extreme outliers without altering the missingness handling. The scaling is applied only to numeric features and does not affect categorical variables.)",
