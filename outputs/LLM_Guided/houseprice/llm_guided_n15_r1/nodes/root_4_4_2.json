For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and for categorical columns, fill NaN with the mode. Use LightGBM's built-in categorical handling by passing categorical feature indices. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before training. Split the data into an 80/20 train/test split and evaluate using r2 score.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use LightGBM with these settings: num_boost_round=650, learning_rate=0.04, max_depth=7. For preprocessing, maintain the median fill for all numeric features, but apply a post-training validation step to detect and remove outliers in the training data (e.g., using IQR-based outlier detection) before training, ensuring the model is not overfitted to extreme values. This small addition improves data quality without altering the core preprocessing or model structure, preserving the robustness of median imputation while reducing the influence of noisy outliers. The learning rate increase from 0.035 to 0.04 slightly increases training sensitivity, which may help in capturing subtle patterns in the data, especially in regions with moderate variance.)",
