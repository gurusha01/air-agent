  "strategy": "Use LightGBM with these settings: num_boost_round=700, learning_rate=0.03, max_depth=8. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Use LightGBM's built-in categorical handling by specifying categorical features. Ensure all categorical features are cast to string type before passing to the model to avoid dtype conversion errors.\n\n(VS suggestion: Tweak the LightGBM hyperparameters to use num_boost_round=650, learning_rate=0.04, and max_depth=7. This slightly increases the learning rate from 0.035 to 0.04, which can improve convergence speed while maintaining stability, especially when combined with a sufficient number of iterations. The max_depth remains unchanged to preserve model interpretability and avoid overfitting. For preprocessing, continue using the median to fill numeric NaN values, but add a post-training validation step to monitor for overfitting on the validation set. If the validation R\u00b2 drops below the training R\u00b2 by more than 0.001, reduce num_boost_round to 600 to prevent overfitting. This variation maintains the original methodology while introducing a small, data-driven adjustment to the learning rate and a safeguard against overfitting, enhancing robustness without altering the core preprocessing or categorical handling.)",
