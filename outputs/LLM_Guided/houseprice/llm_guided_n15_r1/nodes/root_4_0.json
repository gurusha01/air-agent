  "strategy": "Use LightGBM with the following settings: num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.04, max_depth=8. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and pass categorical features directly to LightGBM using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure that the target column 'SalePrice' is correctly identified and used. If you encounter any dtype errors, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Increase the number of boosting rounds to 600 and slightly raise the learning rate to 0.06 while keeping max_depth=7. This improves the model's capacity to capture complex patterns without overfitting, as the higher learning rate with more iterations allows for more gradient updates. For preprocessing, apply median imputation to numeric NaNs but introduce a small threshold (e.g., 10% missing) instead of 50% to retain more potentially useful features. This preserves information from features with moderate missingness, which may contain meaningful signals. Maintain direct categorical input with `categorical_feature` and avoid one-hot encoding.)",
