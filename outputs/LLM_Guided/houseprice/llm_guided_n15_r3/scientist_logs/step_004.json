Do not use get_dummies; instead, pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter dtype errors, cast categorical columns to strings.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters (iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6) has shown to outperform the baseline with a score of 0.9054. This indicates that CatBoost is effective for this dataset, likely due to its ability to handle categorical features natively. Given the remaining budget of 11 nodes, it's prudent to explore another model family that the executor can handle well, such as LightGBM, while also considering a slight refinement of the CatBoost approach to see if further improvements can be made.",
