For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median, and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, ensure all categorical columns are cast to strings before training.",

  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently shown to outperform the baseline and other models, indicating its suitability for this dataset. The best score so far is 0.9065 using CatBoost with specific hyperparameters. Given the remaining nodes, it is wise to continue refining CatBoost to see if further improvements can be made. However, it's important to avoid overfitting by not making drastic changes. Instead, we can try slight variations in hyperparameters to see if we can edge out a better score.",
