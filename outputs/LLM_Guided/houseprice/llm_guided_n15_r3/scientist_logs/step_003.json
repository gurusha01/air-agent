  "direction": "Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings first.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that categorical features are correctly identified and passed to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. Do not use one-hot encoding or get_dummies, as CatBoost can handle categorical data natively. If you encounter any dtype issues, convert categorical columns to strings.",
  "mode": "explore",
  "memory_update": "CatBoost is a suitable model for handling categorical features natively, avoiding the need for complex preprocessing.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts failed due to overly complex approaches and errors related to data handling and model complexity. The executor struggled with implementing cross-validation-based hyperparameter tuning and deep neural networks, which are beyond its capabilities. Given the baseline score of 0.8800, we should focus on simpler, more robust models that the executor can handle well. CatBoost is a good candidate as it handles categorical features natively and is generally robust with default settings.",
