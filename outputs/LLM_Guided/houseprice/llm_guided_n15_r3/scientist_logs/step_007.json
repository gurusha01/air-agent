For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing approach so far has been using CatBoost with specific hyperparameters. The last attempt with CatBoost achieved a score of 0.9065, which is the highest so far. Given that we have 8 nodes remaining, it makes sense to continue refining this approach with slight variations in hyperparameters to see if we can achieve further improvements. Additionally, since LightGBM performed poorly, we should avoid it for now.",
