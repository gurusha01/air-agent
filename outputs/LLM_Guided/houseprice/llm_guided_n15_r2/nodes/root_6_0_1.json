For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, and use LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by passing the categorical feature indices directly to the model. Ensure all categorical features are cast to strings before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the LightGBM hyperparameters to num_boost_round=550, learning_rate=0.05, and max_depth=7. Maintain the original preprocessing strategy (per-feature median imputation, drop columns with >50% missing, categorical features as strings). Instead of using the full training set median for imputation, apply median imputation only to non-missing values within each feature, ensuring robustness to outliers. This balance between increased boosting rounds and moderate learning rate may improve convergence without overfitting, while the slightly reduced depth maintains model stability. This variation retains the core methodology but introduces a more balanced optimization path with a refined learning schedule and slightly more data exposure during training.)",
