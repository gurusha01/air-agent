  "strategy": "Use LightGBM with the following settings: num_boost_round=700, learning_rate=0.03, max_depth=9. For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's native categorical handling by specifying categorical features using the `categorical_feature` parameter. Ensure all categorical features are cast to strings before training.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the learning rate to 0.05 and increase the max_depth to 9, while keeping num_boost_round=600. This slightly increases model capacity to capture more complex non-linear patterns, which may improve fit on the training data. For missing values, instead of using per-feature median imputation, apply the full training set median with a small regularization penalty (e.g., clip median values to avoid extreme outliers). This reduces variance in imputation and may lead to more stable feature distributions. Maintain categorical features as strings and native LightGBM handling. No change to split ratio or preprocessing structure beyond this.)",
