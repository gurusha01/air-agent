For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN with the median, drop columns with >50% missing values. Use LightGBM's native categorical handling by specifying categorical features. Ensure all categorical features are passed as strings to LightGBM.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the LightGBM hyperparameters to num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=7. Maintain the original preprocessing pipeline: fill numeric NaN values with per-feature median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and keep categorical features as strings. Instead of using the full training set median for imputation, apply median imputation only on the training set (per feature), but introduce a small regularization by clipping the median to be within 1% of the interquartile range (IQR) to reduce outliers' influence on imputation. This helps stabilize the median estimate and may reduce variance in feature distributions during training.)",
