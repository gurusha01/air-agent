For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and use LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by passing the categorical feature indices to the model. Ensure all categorical features are cast to string type before training. Use early stopping with a validation set to prevent overfitting.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use LightGBM with the following settings: num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=7. For preprocessing: maintain median imputation per feature, but apply a post-imputation outlier cap by capping extreme values (e.g., 1.5 IQR beyond the first quartile) to reduce noise in the training distribution. This stabilizes gradients during training and may improve generalization without altering the core imputation strategy. Keep categorical features as strings and use native LightGBM handling. Maintain 80/20 split and all other preprocessing steps unchanged.)",
