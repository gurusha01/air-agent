Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string type before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Use LightGBM with the following settings: num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=7. For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median of the full training set (instead of per-feature median), and apply a post-imputation outlier detection step by capping extreme values at 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) of each feature. Maintain categorical features as strings and native LightGBM handling. Keep the 80/20 split and baseline preprocessing structure. This variation improves robustness to missing data bias and reduces noise from extreme imputed values, potentially leading to better generalization.)",
