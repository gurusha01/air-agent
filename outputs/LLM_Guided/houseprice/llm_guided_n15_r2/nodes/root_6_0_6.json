For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's native categorical handling by passing categorical features directly. Ensure to cast categorical columns to strings if needed to avoid dtype errors.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the LightGBM hyperparameters to num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=7. Maintain the original preprocessing pipeline: fill numeric NaN values with per-feature median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use native categorical handling with string casting. Instead of using the full training set median for imputation, apply median imputation only on non-missing values within each feature, ensuring robustness against outliers. This slightly increases learning rate and reduces tree depth to improve generalization while maintaining stability. The smaller depth may enhance interpretability and reduce overfitting on noisy features, potentially leading to better R2 performance on unseen data.)",
