For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Use LightGBM's native categorical feature handling by specifying categorical features as indices. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to string before training.\n\n(VS suggestion: Apply a random forest with 1000 trees, using bootstrap sampling and feature importance-based feature selection to retain only the top 30% most impactful features, then train on the filtered set with early stopping based on R\u00b2 validation. Introduce target encoding for categorical variables with low cardinality (e.g., 'neighborhood', 'condition') using a k=3 smoothing technique to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.)",
