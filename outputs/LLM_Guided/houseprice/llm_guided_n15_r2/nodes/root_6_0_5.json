For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's native categorical handling by specifying categorical features. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.\n\n(VS suggestion: Adjust the LightGBM hyperparameters to num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.05, and max_depth=7. Maintain the original preprocessing pipeline: fill numeric NaN values with per-feature median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and pass categorical features as strings. Instead of using the full training set median for imputation, apply a weighted median imputation where missing values are filled using the median of non-missing values, with a small weight (0.1) applied to outliers. This reduces overestimation due to extreme values in the median while preserving robustness. No change to split ratio or categorical handling.)",
