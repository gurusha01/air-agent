For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by passing them as is. Ensure all categorical features are cast to strings before training. Split the data into an 80/20 train/test split, train the model, and evaluate using the R2 metric.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing node so far is `root_6`, which used LightGBM with specific hyperparameters and preprocessing steps. This node achieved a score of 0.8877, which is better than the baseline. The errors in other nodes were primarily due to issues with feature handling and preprocessing. Given the success of LightGBM and the remaining budget, it makes sense to refine this approach further. We can try a small variation in hyperparameters to see if it improves the score.",
