For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and use LightGBM's native handling for categorical features by passing the categorical feature indices to the model. Ensure all categorical features are cast to string type before training. Use early stopping with a validation set to prevent overfitting.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that all categorical features are cast to string type before passing them to LightGBM. Do not use one-hot encoding or get_dummies as LightGBM can handle categorical features natively. If you encounter a memory error, consider reducing the num_boost_round slightly.",

  "reasoning": "The best performing approach so far has been using LightGBM with specific hyperparameter tuning and native categorical handling, achieving a score of 0.9032. Given the limited nodes remaining, it is prudent to focus on refining this approach further. The previous successful configuration used num_boost_round=600, learning_rate=0.04, and max_depth=8. I will attempt a slight variation in hyperparameters to see if further improvements can be achieved.",
