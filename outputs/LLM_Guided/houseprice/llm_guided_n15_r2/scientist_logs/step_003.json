For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT use get_dummies for categorical columns \u2014 it causes issues with feature handling. Instead, use the `cat_features` parameter in CatBoost. Ensure that you handle NaN values appropriately as specified.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost handles categorical features natively, reducing the risk of feature encoding errors.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts failed due to overly complex approaches or errors in feature handling. The best score so far is the baseline with no model execution. We need a simple, robust model that the executor can handle well. CatBoost is a good choice because it handles categorical features natively and is less prone to errors related to feature encoding. We will use CatBoost with specific hyperparameters and simple preprocessing to avoid the pitfalls seen in previous attempts.",
