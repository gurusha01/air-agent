  "reasoning": "The LightGBM model with specific hyperparameter tuning and native categorical handling has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 0.9032. This indicates that LightGBM is a promising approach for this task. Given the limited nodes remaining, we should focus on refining this approach further to see if we can achieve a higher score. We should try slightly different hyperparameters to see if we can improve the performance further.",
