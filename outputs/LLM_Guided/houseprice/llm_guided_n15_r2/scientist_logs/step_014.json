Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass them directly to LightGBM using the cat_features parameter.

  "reasoning": "The best-performing approach so far has been using LightGBM with specific hyperparameter tuning and native categorical handling. The last successful node achieved a score of 0.9032. Given that we only have one node left, our best strategy is to exploit this approach further by making a small, concrete variation in hyperparameters to see if we can squeeze out a bit more performance.",
