For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LightGBM's native categorical handling by specifying categorical features. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before passing them to the model.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that you handle NaN values appropriately and specify categorical features correctly. Do NOT use get_dummies as it can lead to memory issues. Instead, rely on LightGBM's native handling of categorical features.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing approach so far has been using LightGBM with specific hyperparameter tuning and native categorical handling, achieving a score of 0.9032. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, we should focus on refining this approach further to maximize the score. Previous attempts have shown that small hyperparameter adjustments can lead to improved performance. We should try a slightly different set of hyperparameters to see if we can push the score higher.",
