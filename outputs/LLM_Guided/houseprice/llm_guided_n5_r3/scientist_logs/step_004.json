For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median of each column, use LabelEncoder for categorical columns, and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Split the data into training and validation sets using an 80/20 split. Evaluate the model using the r2 score.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that all categorical columns are label encoded before fitting the model. If you encounter a KeyError related to column names, check that you are using the correct dataset column names. Do not use one-hot encoding as it may lead to memory issues.",

  "memory_update": "XGBoost is a viable alternative to CatBoost for handling missing values and categorical data with label encoding.",
  "reasoning": "The attempts with complex models like deep neural networks and advanced feature engineering have failed or performed poorly. The CatBoost approach failed due to errors during execution, possibly related to handling categorical data or model setup. The baseline score is relatively high, indicating that a simpler model with proper preprocessing might be effective. Given the constraints, using a simpler model like XGBoost with careful preprocessing might yield better results. XGBoost can handle missing values and categorical data with label encoding, which should simplify the process.",
