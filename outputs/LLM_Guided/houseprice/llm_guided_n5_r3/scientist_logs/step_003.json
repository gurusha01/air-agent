  "direction": "Use CatBoost for regression with these settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6. For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median of each column, and drop any columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the categorical feature indices directly to CatBoost using the `cat_features` parameter. Ensure all categorical features are cast to strings before passing them to the model. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing, and evaluate using the R2 metric.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT use get_dummies for categorical features as it can lead to memory issues. Instead, use the `cat_features` parameter in CatBoost. Make sure to handle NaN values appropriately before model training. If you encounter dtype errors, ensure all categorical features are cast to strings.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features natively can simplify preprocessing and potentially improve model performance.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts to use complex models like deep neural networks and advanced feature engineering did not yield successful results. The baseline score is relatively high, suggesting that a simpler model with careful preprocessing might perform well. The best score so far was achieved by the baseline, indicating that the executor struggled with more complex tasks. Given the constraints, a simpler approach using a robust model like CatBoost, which handles categorical features natively, might be effective. CatBoost can automatically handle categorical variables, which simplifies preprocessing and reduces the chance of errors.",
