For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. Ensure that the 'SalePrice' column is correctly identified as the target variable. If you encounter a KeyError related to 'SalePrice', check that the column is present and correctly spelled in the dataset.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the 'SalePrice' column is correctly identified and used as the target variable. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, use the cat_features parameter in CatBoost. If you encounter any dtype errors, cast categorical features to strings.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost handles categorical variables natively and is robust for this dataset, avoiding previous errors with 'SalePrice'.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts have failed due to errors related to the 'SalePrice' column, which is likely the target variable. It seems the executor is having trouble accessing or processing this column. The neural network approach performed poorly, likely due to the executor's limitations with complex models. We should focus on a simpler and more reliable approach. CatBoost is a good candidate as it handles categorical variables natively and is generally robust. We will use CatBoost with specific hyperparameters and simple preprocessing to avoid the previous errors.",
