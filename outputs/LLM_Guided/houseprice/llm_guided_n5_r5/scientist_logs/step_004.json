  "reasoning": "The CatBoostRegressor approach in node root_3 was successful, achieving a score of 0.9025, which is an improvement over the baseline. This indicates that CatBoost is a robust choice for this dataset, likely due to its ability to handle categorical variables natively. The previous attempts with other models failed due to errors related to handling the target variable 'SalePrice'. Given that we have only one node left, it makes sense to refine the CatBoost approach further by tweaking hyperparameters to see if we can achieve a higher score.",
