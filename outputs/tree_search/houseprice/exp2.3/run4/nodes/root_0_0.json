  "strategy": "Increase the polynomial degree from 2 to 3 to capture more complex non-linear interactions (e.g., cubic effects of 'GrLivArea' or 'YearBuilt'), while maintaining the same Ridge regularization (alpha=0.01). This may better model curvilinear trends in the data without introducing excessive overfitting, given that the polynomial features are already regularized. The higher degree can improve fit on complex patterns observed in house price behavior.",
