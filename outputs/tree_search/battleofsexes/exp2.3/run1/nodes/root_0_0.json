  "strategy": "Adjust the weighting of the mixing strategy based on the opponent's action frequency, but apply a dynamic decay factor to older interactions. For example, only consider the last 3 rounds of opponent behavior when computing the bias, and reduce the influence of actions from more than 3 rounds ago by a factor of 0.7 per round. This reduces noise from outdated patterns while maintaining responsiveness to recent behavior. Use a 70% weight on the most frequent recent action and 30% on the less frequent one.",
