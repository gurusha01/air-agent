  "strategy": "Increase the memory window from 3 to 5 previous rounds to capture more historical patterns in opponent behavior. This allows for a smoother estimation of opponent preferences over time, improving the accuracy of the mixing probability adjustment. However, to prevent overfitting, keep the adjustment magnitude at 10% and apply a moving average of the observed actions over the 5-round window to stabilize the estimate. This variation provides a more robust signal for long-term trends without sacrificing stability.",
