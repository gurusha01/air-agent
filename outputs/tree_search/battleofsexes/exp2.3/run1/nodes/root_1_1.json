This allows for initial stability in strategy selection (to learn the opponent's tendencies), followed by a transition to a more exploratory phase. The gradual reduction in decay encourages a smoother shift from exploitation to exploration, which may improve average payoff by adapting to the opponent\u2019s behavior without abrupt changes that could be predictable.",
