  "strategy": "Instead of using a fixed 70-30 split, implement a probabilistic weight that adapts based on the variance in opponent behavior. If the opponent's actions are highly variable (standard deviation > 0.3), increase the bias toward the most common action to 80% with 20% on the other. If variance is low (standard deviation < 0.1), maintain a balanced 50-50 split to avoid predictability. This makes the strategy more adaptive to opponent consistency or inconsistency.",
