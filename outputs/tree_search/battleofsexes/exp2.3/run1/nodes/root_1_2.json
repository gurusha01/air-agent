  "strategy": "Add a small bias term (e.g., +0.05) to the probability of the less frequently chosen action, ensuring that the strategy remains balanced even during periods of high decay. This prevents the system from drifting toward extreme exploitation of a single action and maintains a consistent level of mixing. The decay factor remains at 95%, but the added bias ensures that both actions are given a non-negligible chance, which is critical in a coordination game like Battle of Sexes.",
