  "strategy": "Modify the decay factor from 95% to 90% per round. This increases the rate at which previously used actions are downweighted, encouraging more exploration of underused strategies. While the decay is less aggressive than 95%, it still maintains a gradual shift toward diversity in choices, which can be beneficial in the Battle of Sexes game where coordination and unpredictability both matter. This slight increase in exploration might allow the row player to better adapt to the column player's behavior patterns over time without losing the core mixing strategy.",
