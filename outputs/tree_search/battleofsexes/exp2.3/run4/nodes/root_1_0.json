  "strategy": "Modify the adaptive learning rate to a time-varying decay function instead of a constant value. Use a learning rate that starts at 0.01 and decays exponentially over time (e.g., \u03b1(t) = 0.01 * exp(-t/100)), where t is the number of rounds. This allows the row player to react quickly in the early rounds when learning patterns, while gradually reducing sensitivity to noise in later rounds, preventing overfitting. This dynamic decay maintains responsiveness to consistent behavior while promoting stability over time.",
