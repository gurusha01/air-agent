Use a simple 3-round moving average (e.g., average of the last three payoffs) to reduce the impact of short-term noise. The adaptive learning rate (0.01) is applied only to the smoothed payoff, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio and leads to more stable and reliable updates in the expected payoff estimation.",
