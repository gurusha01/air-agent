  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic weighting factor that adjusts the priority of mutual cooperation based on the historical frequency of coordination in past rounds. Specifically, if the row player and column player have coordinated (both chose the same action) in more than 60% of the previous 5 rounds, increase the weight given to the cooperative outcome by 10%. This leverages learned patterns in opponent behavior to amplify the value of mutual cooperation when it's been consistently observed, subtly biasing the strategy toward coordination in stable environments.",
