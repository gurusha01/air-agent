Instead of reacting immediately to each round, the strategy computes a 3-round moving average of the row player\u2019s payoff in cooperative outcomes and uses this smoothed value to determine the weight assigned to mutual cooperation. This reduces noise and helps avoid overreacting to transient mismatches.",
