Instead of a linear 10% boost per matching round, apply a 10% increase to the confidence weight, but with a multiplicative factor (e.g., 1.1^k where k is the number of consecutive matches). This means the boost accelerates over time\u2014after 1 match: 1.1\u00d7, after 2: ~1.21\u00d7, after 3: ~1.33\u00d7\u2014making the strategy more responsive to longer streaks without being linearly biased. This better captures the diminishing marginal returns of repeated patterns.",
