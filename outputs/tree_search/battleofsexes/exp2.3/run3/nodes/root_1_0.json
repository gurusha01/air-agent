  "strategy": "Variation: Introduce a decaying confidence window for past matches. Instead of adding a fixed 10% boost per consecutive matching round, apply a 10% increase only to the most recent 3 consecutive rounds, with a 20% decay factor for rounds older than 3. This limits overfitting to distant patterns while still rewarding recent alignment. For example, if the opponent matched the prediction in rounds 2, 3, and 4, the confidence boost is applied with full weight; if matches spanned rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, only rounds 2\u20134 contribute, and round 1 is discounted. This maintains responsiveness to short-term patterns while reducing sensitivity to outdated data.",
