For instance, if the column player chose the high-value option in the last two rounds, the belief is increased by 0.1 to 0.7; otherwise, it remains at 0.6. This adds a minimal adaptive component to the prior while staying within the predictive framework. The update is constrained to avoid overfitting and is designed to exploit subtle patterns without introducing instability.  \n<probability>0.65</probability>",
