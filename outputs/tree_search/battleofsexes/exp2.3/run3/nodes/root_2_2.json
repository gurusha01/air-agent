For example, if the column player\u2019s action has remained consistent over the last 3 rounds (e.g., always choosing Action A), reduce the payoff of choosing the opposite action by 5% only when the row player's payoff in mutual cooperation is higher. This encourages coordination when the opponent exhibits stable behavior, leveraging predictability to refine the cooperative bias.",
