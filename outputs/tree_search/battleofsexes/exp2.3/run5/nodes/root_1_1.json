  "strategy": "The second variation introduces a dynamic noise scaling mechanism: the standard deviation of the noise is scaled based on the number of rounds played. Specifically, after every 5 rounds, the noise standard deviation increases by 0.01 (e.g., from 0.05 to 0.06, then 0.07, etc.), up to a maximum of 0.10. This creates a gradual exploration ramp that starts conservatively and increases over time, allowing the row player to exploit potential shifts in the opponent\u2019s behavior without early over-exploration.",
