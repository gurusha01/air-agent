  "strategy": "The first variation increases the standard deviation of the noise injection from 0.05 to 0.10 to encourage more exploration. This larger noise may help the row player escape predictable patterns that the column player might exploit, especially in repeated interactions where the opponent adapts. However, it is carefully balanced to avoid destabilizing the average payoff, as excessive noise can reduce performance by introducing random deviations from the optimal mixed strategy.",
