  "strategy": "Variation: Introduce a moving window of the last 5 rounds to calculate the volatility of the row player's payoffs instead of relying on the entire history. This allows for faster adaptation to short-term shifts in the column player's behavior without overreacting to long-term noise. When the volatility in the last 5 rounds is below a threshold (e.g., 0.1), reduce the exploration rate by 10%. When volatility exceeds the threshold, increase exploration by 15%. This provides more responsive and context-sensitive scaling of the learning rate based on recent behavior patterns.\n\nThis approach improves responsiveness to immediate behavioral changes while maintaining stability in consistent scenarios.",
