  "strategy": "Variation: Apply a sigmoidal transformation to the payoff volatility to smooth transitions in exploration rate. Instead of using fixed thresholds, compute the volatility (e.g., standard deviation of row payoffs over last 4 rounds), then apply a sigmoid function (\u03c3(x) = 1/(1+e^(-k(x\u2212threshold)))) to map volatility into a continuous exploration rate adjustment. This creates a soft, gradual transition between high and low exploration, avoiding abrupt jumps that could disrupt learning.\n\nThis improves smoothness and stability in exploration, especially during transitional phases of behavior.",
