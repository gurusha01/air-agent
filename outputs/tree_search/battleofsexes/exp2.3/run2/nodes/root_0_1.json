  "strategy": "Variation 2: Scale the payoff difference by a dynamic scaling factor (e.g., 1.2 or 0.8) based on the current round number or accumulated score. This adjusts the sensitivity of the sigmoid transition to reflect increasing or decreasing confidence in the payoff difference. For example, early rounds use a higher sensitivity to explore, while later rounds reduce sensitivity to stabilize decisions. This adaptive scaling helps balance exploration and exploitation over time.",
