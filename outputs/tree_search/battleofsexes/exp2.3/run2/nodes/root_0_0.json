  "strategy": "Variation 1: Introduce a small noise term (Gaussian noise) added to the payoff difference input before applying the sigmoid function. This enhances exploration by preventing the strategy from converging too rigidly to a single decision boundary, allowing for more adaptive responses in dynamic environments. The noise level is set to 0.01 standard deviation, scaled to the magnitude of the payoff difference. This maintains smooth transitions while introducing slight stochasticity that can improve long-term average payoff in non-stationary scenarios.",
