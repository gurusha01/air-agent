  "strategy": "Variation: Replace the global stability metric with a per-round payoff variance threshold. Instead of evaluating consistency across all history, compute the standard deviation of the row player's payoffs over the last 3 rounds. If the standard deviation is below 0.05, interpret this as high consistency and reduce exploration by 20%. If it exceeds 0.15, increase exploration by 25%. This makes the adaptation more granular and directly tied to observable fluctuation in immediate outcomes.\n\nThis variation enhances sensitivity to real-time shifts and reduces lag in responding to behavioral changes.",
