The model learns the opponent's tendencies and adjusts its own move (Cooperate or Defect) to maximize expected payoff over time, with a baseline starting probability of 0.5 for choosing the row player's preferred option (e.g., going to the movie), increasing if the opponent consistently chooses the other option.",
