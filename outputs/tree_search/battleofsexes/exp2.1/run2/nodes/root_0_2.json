The row player computes the phase of the opponent\u2019s move sequence (e.g., using a sine wave fit over the last 10 rounds) and adjusts their choice accordingly. If the phase indicates a peak in \"Movie\" choices, the row player selects \"Game\" with 75% probability to misalign; otherwise, they mirror with 70% probability, creating a phase-shifted anti-correlation to exploit periodicity.",
