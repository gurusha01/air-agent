Specifically, if the opponent chose \"Movie\" in the previous round, the row player selects \"Game\" with 70% probability and \"Movie\" with 30%; otherwise, they select \"Movie\" with 70% and \"Game\" with 30%. This introduces temporal dependence and adaptive learning to exploit patterns in opponent behavior.",
