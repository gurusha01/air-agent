  "strategy": "The row player implements a payoff-weighted strategy where coordination is chosen with a probability proportional to the expected payoff difference between coordination and misalignment in the current round. This uses a simple reinforcement learning-like update: the probability of coordination is set to (payoff_coordinate + 0.5) / (payoff_coordinate + payoff_misalign), where payoffs are estimated from the history. This strategy fundamentally shifts from fixed randomness to dynamic payoff estimation, making it sensitive to actual outcomes.",
