  "strategy": "Use a Gaussian process regression model to predict the column player\u2019s likely choice based on historical action patterns. The row player observes past choices and fits a GP to model the probability of the column player selecting each option. The row player then selects the action that maximizes their expected payoff, derived from the predicted probability and known payoffs. This approach provides uncertainty-aware decisions and handles non-linear dependencies in the data.",
