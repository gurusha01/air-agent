  "strategy": "Use a Bayesian belief-updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior probability distribution over the column player\u2019s type (e.g., \"predictable\" or \"unpredictable\") based on observed choices. If the column player appears predictable, the row player randomizes more heavily; if unpredictable, it focuses on high-payoff actions. The initial belief is 50-50, and the posterior is updated after each round using Bayes\u2019 rule. This strategy combines type inference with adaptive randomness to optimize payoff.",
