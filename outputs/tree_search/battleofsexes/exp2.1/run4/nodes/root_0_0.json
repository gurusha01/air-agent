  "strategy": "The row player adopts a time-varying mixed strategy where the coordination probability dynamically adjusts based on the column player's past choices. Specifically, if the column player has coordinated with the row player in the last two rounds, the row player increases coordination probability to 70% to reinforce mutual benefit. If the column player has consistently misaligned, the row player reduces coordination to 30% to exploit inconsistency and force the column player to reassess. This strategy leverages behavioral pattern recognition and temporal feedback to adapt to the opponent\u2019s strategy over time.",
