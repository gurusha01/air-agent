  "strategy": "Implement a mirror-strategy where the row player replicates the column player\u2019s previous action from the prior round with a 60% probability, while choosing the alternative action with 40% probability. This induces a form of strategic symmetry that disrupts the column player\u2019s ability to predict the row player\u2019s move, as the column player may misjudge the row player's intentions. The strategy leverages behavioral mimicry to create unpredictability and exploit the column player's tendency to react to patterns.",
