  "strategy": "Adopt a dynamic learning-based strategy using a Q-learning-inspired approach where the row player updates the value of each action (football or opera) based on observed outcomes over time. After each round, the row player estimates the column player's response pattern and adjusts its action selection to maximize expected payoff. The strategy starts with uniform exploration (50% football, 50% opera) and gradually shifts toward actions that yield higher payoffs in past interactions. This adaptive behavior exploits the column player's potential inconsistency in play, leading to improved long-term performance.",
