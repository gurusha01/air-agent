  "strategy": "Adaptive payoff-weighted strategy: The row player dynamically adjusts the probability of choosing Action A or B based on the frequency of the opponent's past choices. If the opponent has chosen Action A more than 50% of the time, the row player increases the probability of choosing Action B to exploit potential coordination in the opponent's pattern. Conversely, if the opponent has chosen Action B more than 50%, the row player increases the probability of choosing Action A. This strategy uses a simple moving average of the opponent's last 5 actions to compute the current probability.",
