If the opponent tends to choose Action A immediately after the row player chooses Action B, the row player increases the probability of choosing Action A in the next round to anticipate and align with the opponent's behavior. This leverages temporal autocorrelation in choices and assumes the opponent has a behavioral rhythm.",
