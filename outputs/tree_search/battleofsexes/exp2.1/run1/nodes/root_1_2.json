  "strategy": "Introduce a feedback-based linear regression model where the row player estimates the column player's action probability as a function of past actions and the row player's own actions. Using historical data, the model fits a linear equation to predict the column player's response, and the row player adjusts their action probabilities to maximize a predicted payoff derived from this regression. This is a classical supervised learning approach using historical action patterns.",
