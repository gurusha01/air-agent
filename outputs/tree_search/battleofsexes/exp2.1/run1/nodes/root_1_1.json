Each strategy is a vector of action probabilities, and fitness is evaluated based on average payoff against simulated column player behavior. Strategies are selected, mutated, and crossed over in each generation to maximize long-term average payoff. This is a population-based evolutionary strategy that avoids explicit reinforcement learning and instead uses natural selection principles.",
