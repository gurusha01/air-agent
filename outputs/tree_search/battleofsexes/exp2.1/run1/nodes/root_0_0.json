  "strategy": "Adaptive reinforcement learning with epsilon-greedy exploration: The row player observes past interactions and updates the probability of choosing Action A or B based on the column player's actual payoff responses. After each round, the row player increases the probability of the action that led to a higher payoff (using a learning rate of 0.1), while maintaining a small epsilon (0.05) chance of exploring a random action to avoid convergence to suboptimal equilibria. This strategy dynamically adjusts based on real-time feedback, unlike static mixed strategies.",
