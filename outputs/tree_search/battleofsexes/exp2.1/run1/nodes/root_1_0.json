  "strategy": "Implement a mixed-strategy equilibrium based on Bayesian updating of the column player's type distribution. Assume the column player has a private signal about their preference (e.g., high or low value for each action), and the row player updates their belief about this signal using Bayes' rule after observing past actions. The row player then selects actions according to a posterior-optimized probability that maximizes expected payoff under uncertainty. This strategy uses probabilistic modeling of opponent types rather than direct action feedback.",
