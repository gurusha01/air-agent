This involves evaluating the immediate payoffs for both coordination and non-coordination options given the opponent's recent behavior and selecting the one with the highest expected value. This approach assumes the opponent will respond in a predictable manner based on past patterns, and the row player can exploit this by consistently choosing the higher-reward option.",
