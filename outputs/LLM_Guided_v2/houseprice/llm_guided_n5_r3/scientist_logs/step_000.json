Do NOT use get_dummies for categorical columns \u2014 instead, pass cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you get a dtype error, cast categoricals to str first.",

  "reasoning": "Since this is the first attempt, we have no previous results to analyze. We need to start with a simple, reliable model and preprocessing strategy that the executor can handle well. CatBoost is a good choice because it handles categorical features natively, which simplifies preprocessing. We will use a straightforward preprocessing approach to handle missing values and leverage CatBoost's capabilities.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with default settings and simple preprocessing \u2014 CatBoost is robust with categorical data and can handle missing values, making it a good starting point.\n2. Use LightGBM with basic preprocessing (fillna and label encoding) \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and can handle large datasets well, but requires more preprocessing.\n3. Use XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning \u2014 XGBoost is powerful but requires careful tuning and preprocessing, which might be complex for the executor.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost's native handling of categorical features and missing values makes it the simplest and most reliable choice for the executor to implement successfully.",
