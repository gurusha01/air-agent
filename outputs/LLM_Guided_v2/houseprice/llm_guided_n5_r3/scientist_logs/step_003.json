The LightGBM attempt failed due to a KeyError related to the 'SalePrice' column, indicating a possible issue with the dataset split or column selection. Given the remaining nodes, refining the CatBoost approach with slight hyperparameter adjustments could yield further improvements.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with iterations=600, learning_rate=0.025, depth=7 \u2014 This might improve the score by fine-tuning the hyperparameters slightly, leveraging CatBoost's strengths.\n2. Try XGBoost with specific settings: n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6 \u2014 XGBoost is a strong performer in regression tasks and could provide a competitive score.\n3. Simplify LightGBM approach by ensuring correct dataset split and column handling \u2014 This could resolve the previous error and allow LightGBM to be a viable option.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing model so far with slight adjustments that are likely to improve performance without introducing complexity.",
