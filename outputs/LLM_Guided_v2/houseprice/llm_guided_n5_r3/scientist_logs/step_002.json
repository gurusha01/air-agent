  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters and preprocessing steps worked well, achieving a score of 0.9084. The LightGBM attempt failed due to a KeyError, likely because the 'SalePrice' column was not properly handled. This suggests that the preprocessing for LightGBM was not correctly implemented, particularly in terms of ensuring the target variable is correctly separated and handled. Given the success of CatBoost, it makes sense to refine this approach further to see if we can improve the score. We should also consider trying a different model family to diversify our approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 This might improve the score further by fine-tuning the model's performance.\n2. Try XGBoost with specific settings \u2014 XGBoost is another robust model that might perform well with similar preprocessing steps.\n3. Fix LightGBM preprocessing and retry \u2014 Correcting the preprocessing error might allow us to leverage LightGBM's strengths.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because refining the already successful CatBoost model is likely to yield a better score with minimal risk.",
