The LightGBM attempt failed due to a KeyError related to the 'SalePrice' column, indicating a potential issue with data splitting or preprocessing. Since CatBoost has been effective, refining its hyperparameters further could yield better results. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on exploiting the best-performing approach is prudent.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost hyperparameters: iterations=550, learning_rate=0.028, depth=6 \u2014 This might improve the score by fine-tuning the model's complexity and learning rate.\n2. Try XGBoost with default settings \u2014 As a new model family, it might provide a different perspective and potentially improve the score.\n3. Use LightGBM again with corrected preprocessing \u2014 Fix the KeyError issue and attempt a simple LightGBM model to see if it can match or exceed CatBoost's performance.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing model and is likely to yield incremental improvements with minimal risk.",
