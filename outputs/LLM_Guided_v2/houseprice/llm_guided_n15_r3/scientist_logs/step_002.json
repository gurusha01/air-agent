The LightGBM model, however, underperformed with a score of 0.8167, suggesting that the chosen hyperparameters or preprocessing might not have been optimal. Since CatBoost showed promise, it would be beneficial to explore slight variations in its hyperparameters to potentially improve the score further. Additionally, trying another model like XGBoost could provide a different perspective and possibly better results.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost by adjusting hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost performed well, and slight tuning might yield even better results.\n2. Try XGBoost with specific hyperparameters \u2014 XGBoost is another powerful model that can handle large datasets and might outperform CatBoost with the right settings.\n3. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor \u2014 Random forests are robust and might provide a competitive baseline or insights into feature importance.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost already showed a promising result, and refining it could lead to an even better score with minimal risk.",
