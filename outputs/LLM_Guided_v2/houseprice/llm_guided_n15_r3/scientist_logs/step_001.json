  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters has shown a promising improvement over the baseline score. It effectively handles categorical data and missing values, which are common in house price prediction datasets. However, to ensure robustness and explore potential improvements, it's beneficial to try other models known for their performance in regression tasks. LightGBM is another powerful model that can handle large datasets efficiently and is worth exploring.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Try LightGBM with specific hyperparameters \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and can handle large datasets well, which might lead to further improvements.\n2. Refine CatBoost hyperparameters \u2014 Further tuning CatBoost could yield marginal gains, but the current setup is already strong.\n3. Try XGBoost with specific hyperparameters \u2014 XGBoost is another strong contender for regression tasks and might perform well with this dataset.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because LightGBM is efficient and might provide a performance boost over CatBoost, especially if the dataset is large.",
