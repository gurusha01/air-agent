Do NOT use get_dummies for categorical columns \u2014 instead, pass cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you get a dtype error, cast categoricals to str first.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's performance is sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, suggesting further potential for optimization around the best settings.",
  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently outperformed other models with minimal preprocessing, indicating its robustness in handling categorical and missing data. The best score achieved so far is 0.9145 with specific hyperparameters. Given the limited number of nodes left, it's prudent to focus on refining the CatBoost model further, as it has shown the most promise. Small hyperparameter adjustments have shown potential for further optimization.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Slightly adjust CatBoost hyperparameters: iterations=830, learning_rate=0.037, depth=6.5 \u2014 This might capture a sweet spot between previously tested values.\n2. Slightly adjust CatBoost hyperparameters: iterations=820, learning_rate=0.039, depth=6 \u2014 This could further optimize the learning rate, which has shown sensitivity.\n3. Try a new model like RandomForest with default settings \u2014 While unlikely to outperform CatBoost, it could provide a useful comparison.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing node with a small tweak, which is likely to yield incremental improvement given the executor's capabilities.",
