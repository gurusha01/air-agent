  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently outperformed other models, indicating its robustness in handling categorical and missing data efficiently. The best score was achieved with CatBoost using specific hyperparameters. LightGBM and XGBoost did not perform as well, with XGBoost failing due to unseen labels. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on refining CatBoost seems prudent.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further refine CatBoost with slightly adjusted hyperparameters \u2014 This might yield a marginal improvement as CatBoost has shown sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning.\n2. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor from sklearn \u2014 It could provide a different perspective and might handle the data well with minimal preprocessing.\n3. Revisit LightGBM with a different set of hyperparameters \u2014 It might perform better with a different configuration, though previous attempts were not promising.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has consistently provided the best results, and small adjustments could lead to further improvements.",
