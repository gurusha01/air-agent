  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently outperformed other models in our attempts, with the best score being 0.9141. This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical data and missing values is a significant advantage. LightGBM and XGBoost have not performed as well, with LightGBM scoring 0.8167 and XGBoost failing due to unseen labels. Given the limited number of nodes left, it makes sense to focus on refining the CatBoost model further to maximize our score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further refine CatBoost with slightly adjusted hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost has shown strong performance, and small tweaks might yield incremental improvements.\n2. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor with default settings \u2014 It might provide a competitive baseline and is straightforward to implement.\n3. Use a simple Ridge regression model \u2014 This could offer insights into linear relationships in the data and is easy to implement.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has consistently shown the best results, and further refinement could lead to an even higher score.",
