  "reasoning": "CatBoost has been the most successful model so far, consistently outperforming other models due to its robustness in handling categorical and missing data. The best score achieved was 0.9141 with CatBoost. Attempts to use LightGBM and XGBoost did not yield better results, with XGBoost failing due to unseen labels. We have room to further refine CatBoost by adjusting hyperparameters or exploring additional preprocessing steps.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further refine CatBoost by increasing iterations and slightly adjusting learning rate \u2014 This could potentially improve the score by allowing the model to learn more complex patterns.\n2. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor from sklearn \u2014 While not expected to outperform CatBoost, it might provide a competitive baseline if tuned correctly.\n3. Re-attempt XGBoost with better preprocessing to handle unseen labels \u2014 This could work if we ensure all categorical variables are properly encoded and no unseen labels are present.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has shown the best results and further refinement could yield the highest improvement with minimal risk.",
