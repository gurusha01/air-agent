For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the `cat_features` parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings first.",

  "reasoning": "Since this is the first attempt, we don't have any accumulated knowledge from previous nodes. The baseline score is 0.8800, and we need to improve upon this using a simple, implementable model. Given the executor's strengths, we should start with a straightforward model that it can handle well, such as CatBoost, which is robust to different data types and missing values.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with default settings \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features natively and is robust to missing values, making it a good starting point.\n2. Use LightGBM with basic preprocessing \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and often performs well with minimal tuning, but requires explicit handling of categorical features.\n3. Use XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning \u2014 XGBoost is powerful but may require more tuning and preprocessing, which could be risky for the executor.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost is well-suited for the executor's capabilities, handling categorical data and missing values without extensive preprocessing.",
