  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently provided the best results, with the highest score achieved using specific hyperparameters. The executor's attempts with LightGBM and XGBoost were less successful, with XGBoost failing due to unseen labels. The CatBoost model's sensitivity to hyperparameter changes suggests potential for further optimization. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on refining the best-performing CatBoost model is the most promising approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase CatBoost iterations slightly and adjust learning rate \u2014 This might improve the model's performance by allowing it to learn more complex patterns.\n2. Try a different depth setting with CatBoost \u2014 A different tree depth might capture more intricate relationships in the data.\n3. Experiment with a small ensemble of CatBoost models \u2014 This could potentially improve performance by averaging predictions, but might be risky given the executor's limitations.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly builds on the best-performing model with minimal changes, maximizing the chance of improvement within the executor's capabilities.",
