LightGBM, on the other hand, performed worse than the baseline, indicating that it might not be the best choice for this dataset without further tuning. XGBoost failed due to unseen labels, suggesting issues with handling categorical data. Given the executor's strengths, focusing on CatBoost with slight hyperparameter tuning or trying another model like RandomForest, which can handle categorical data, might yield improvements.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Tune CatBoost further with different hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost has shown promise, and slight adjustments might improve the score.\n2. Implement RandomForest with default settings \u2014 RandomForest can handle categorical data and might perform well without complex preprocessing.\n3. Retry XGBoost with explicit handling of categorical features \u2014 This might work if we ensure all categorical data is properly encoded.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has already shown good results, and further tuning could lead to improvements.",
