  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently outperformed other models, indicating its robustness in handling categorical and missing data efficiently. The best score so far was achieved with CatBoost using iterations=800, learning_rate=0.04, and depth=6. Attempts to further improve this with different hyperparameters have not yielded better results. LightGBM and XGBoost have not performed as well, with XGBoost failing due to unseen labels.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Try a different model family, like RandomForest, with minimal preprocessing \u2014 it might perform well with default settings and handle categorical data reasonably well.\n2. Further refine CatBoost by slightly adjusting hyperparameters around the best-performing settings \u2014 small tweaks might yield marginal improvements.\n3. Use a simple ensemble of the best CatBoost model and a RandomForest model \u2014 combining predictions might improve the overall score.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because CatBoost has consistently performed well, and small hyperparameter tweaks around the best settings might yield the best effort-to-reward ratio.",
