For preprocessing: fill numeric NaN values with the median, drop columns with more than 50% missing values, and use LabelEncoder for categorical columns. Ensure categorical features are specified using the categorical_feature parameter in LightGBM. If you encounter a memory error, reduce n_estimators to 500.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters has shown promise, achieving a score of 0.9094, which is an improvement over the baseline. However, a subsequent attempt with different hyperparameters resulted in a lower score. This suggests that while CatBoost is effective, hyperparameter tuning is crucial. Given the limited nodes remaining, exploring a different model family could provide additional insights and potentially better performance.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with specific hyperparameters \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles categorical features well when specified. It might provide a competitive score with the right settings.\n2. Use XGBoost with specific hyperparameters \u2014 XGBoost is robust and often performs well in regression tasks. It could offer a different perspective on the data.\n3. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 Further tuning CatBoost might yield a better score, but there's a risk of diminishing returns given previous attempts.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because LightGBM is a strong model for regression tasks and can handle categorical features efficiently. It offers a good balance of performance and ease of implementation for the executor.",
