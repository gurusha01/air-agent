The LightGBM attempt failed due to context length issues, indicating that the approach might have been too complex or verbose for the executor. Given the success with CatBoost, it makes sense to refine this approach further. \n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with slightly different hyperparameters \u2014 This might yield a better score as CatBoost has already shown promise.\n2. Try XGBoost with default settings \u2014 XGBoost is another robust model for regression tasks and might perform well with minimal tuning.\n3. Simplify LightGBM attempt with fewer features or simpler preprocessing \u2014 This might resolve the context length issue and allow LightGBM to be evaluated.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has already demonstrated a positive result, and refining it with slight hyperparameter adjustments is likely to yield further improvements.",
