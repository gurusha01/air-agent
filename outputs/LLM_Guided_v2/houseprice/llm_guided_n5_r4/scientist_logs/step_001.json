This indicates that CatBoost is effective for this dataset, likely due to its ability to handle categorical data efficiently. Since we have limited nodes left, it makes sense to refine this approach further to see if we can achieve a better score. We should also consider trying a different model to ensure diversity in our approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 This might improve the score slightly by fine-tuning the model further.\n2. Try LightGBM with basic preprocessing \u2014 LightGBM is also good with categorical data and might provide a competitive score.\n3. Use XGBoost with basic preprocessing \u2014 XGBoost is another strong model for regression tasks and could offer a different perspective.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because refining the CatBoost model with different hyperparameters is likely to yield a better score given its previous success and our limited node budget.",
