  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently provided the best results, with the highest score achieved being 0.9099. Attempts with XGBoost and LightGBM failed due to categorical feature handling issues. Fine-tuning CatBoost hyperparameters has shown small improvements, indicating this approach is promising. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on refining CatBoost seems to be the most efficient strategy.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further fine-tune CatBoost hyperparameters (iterations and learning_rate) \u2014 This might yield a slight improvement given past results.\n2. Try a different preprocessing strategy with CatBoost, such as scaling numerical features \u2014 Could potentially improve model performance by normalizing feature scales.\n3. Introduce feature selection to reduce dimensionality before using CatBoost \u2014 Might enhance performance by removing irrelevant features, but risky due to executor's limitations.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it has shown consistent improvements with minimal risk and aligns with the executor's strengths.",
