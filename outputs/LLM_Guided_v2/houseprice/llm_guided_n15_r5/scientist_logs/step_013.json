  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters has consistently provided the best results, with a score of 0.9099. Attempts to use XGBoost and LightGBM failed due to errors related to unseen labels and mismatched categorical features, respectively. This suggests that CatBoost's native handling of categorical data is particularly advantageous for this dataset. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, the focus should be on refining the CatBoost model further to maximize the R\u00b2 score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Fine-tune CatBoost with slightly adjusted hyperparameters \u2014 This approach has shown incremental improvements and is likely to yield the best results given the executor's capabilities.\n2. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor from sklearn \u2014 It might provide a different perspective, but the risk is high given the executor's limitations and the previous failures with other models.\n3. Use a slightly different preprocessing strategy with CatBoost \u2014 Adjusting how missing values are handled or trying a different encoding strategy might yield improvements.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because fine-tuning CatBoost has consistently improved the score, and it aligns well with the executor's strengths.",
