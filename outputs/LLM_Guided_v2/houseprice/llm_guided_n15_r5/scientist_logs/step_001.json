  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters performed well, achieving a score of 0.9084. This suggests that models capable of handling categorical features directly and dealing with missing values effectively are beneficial. We have not yet explored other model families that the executor can implement, such as XGBoost or LightGBM, which are also known for their strong performance in regression tasks.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use XGBoost with hyperparameters: n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6. Preprocess by filling numeric NaN with median and use LabelEncoder for categorical features \u2014 XGBoost is robust and can handle large datasets efficiently.\n2. Use LightGBM with hyperparameters: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500. Preprocess by filling numeric NaN with median and use LabelEncoder for categorical features \u2014 LightGBM is known for its speed and efficiency, especially with large datasets.\n3. Refine the CatBoost model by adjusting hyperparameters: iterations=700, learning_rate=0.02, depth=7. Keep the same preprocessing \u2014 further tuning CatBoost might yield a slight improvement given its previous success.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because XGBoost is a strong alternative model that can handle regression tasks well, and exploring it might provide a competitive score compared to CatBoost.",
