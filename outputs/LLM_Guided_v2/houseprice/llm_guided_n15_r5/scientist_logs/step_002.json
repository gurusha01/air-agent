  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model performed well, achieving a score of 0.9084, which is better than the baseline. The XGBoost attempt failed due to an error related to unseen labels, likely caused by improper handling of categorical features. CatBoost's ability to handle categorical data natively without explicit encoding is a strength. We should explore other models that can handle categorical data effectively or refine the CatBoost approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost performed well; tweaking hyperparameters might yield better results.\n2. Try LightGBM with categorical feature support \u2014 LightGBM is known for its speed and efficiency, and it can handle categorical features when specified.\n3. Use RandomForestRegressor with one-hot encoding \u2014 Random forests are robust and might perform well with explicit feature engineering.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because refining CatBoost is likely to yield improvements given its strong initial performance and ability to handle categorical data directly.",
