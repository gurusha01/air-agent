  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters (iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6) achieved the best score so far (0.9084). This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly is beneficial for this task. Attempts with XGBoost and LightGBM failed due to issues with handling categorical features and mismatched datasets. Thus, focusing on CatBoost with slight hyperparameter adjustments seems promising. Additionally, exploring a simple model like RandomForest could provide a baseline comparison.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Adjust CatBoost hyperparameters (iterations=600, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6) \u2014 This might improve the score slightly by allowing more iterations while keeping the learning rate stable.\n2. Use RandomForest with n_estimators=500 and max_depth=10 \u2014 A simpler model could provide a useful baseline and might perform well with minimal preprocessing.\n3. Try LightGBM again with better handling of categorical features \u2014 If implemented correctly, it could potentially match or exceed CatBoost's performance.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing approach with a small, concrete variation that the executor can handle.",
