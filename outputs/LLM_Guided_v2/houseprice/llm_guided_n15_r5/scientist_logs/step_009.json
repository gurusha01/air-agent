  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameter tuning has shown the best results so far, with a score of 0.9099. The executor has struggled with other models, such as XGBoost and LightGBM, due to issues with categorical features and unseen labels. CatBoost's ability to handle categorical data directly without preprocessing has been advantageous. Further fine-tuning of CatBoost's hyperparameters might yield incremental improvements.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further fine-tune CatBoost with slightly different hyperparameters \u2014 This could improve the score slightly as previous fine-tuning attempts have shown small gains.\n2. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor with basic preprocessing \u2014 This provides a different model family and might give insights into feature importance, though it might not outperform CatBoost.\n3. Use a simple Linear Regression with feature scaling \u2014 This is a baseline comparison with minimal preprocessing, but it is unlikely to outperform CatBoost.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has consistently performed well, and further fine-tuning could yield the best results within the remaining node budget.",
