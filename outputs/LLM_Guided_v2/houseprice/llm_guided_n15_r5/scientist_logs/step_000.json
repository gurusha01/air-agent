Do NOT use get_dummies for categorical columns \u2014 instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you get a dtype error, cast categoricals to str first.",
  "executor_guidance": "Make sure to handle NaN values in numeric columns by filling them with the median. Do not use one-hot encoding for categorical features; instead, pass them directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter any dtype issues with categorical features, convert them to strings before passing them to the model.",

  "reasoning": "We have a baseline score of 0.8800 without any model execution. Our goal is to improve upon this using a simple and effective approach. Given the executor's strengths, we should focus on models that are straightforward to implement and require minimal custom coding. CatBoost is a good candidate due to its ability to handle categorical features directly and its robustness in handling missing values.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with default settings \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features natively and is robust, which could improve the baseline score.\n2. Use LightGBM with basic preprocessing \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and can handle large datasets well. It might provide a good balance between speed and accuracy.\n3. Use XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning \u2014 XGBoost is a powerful model, but requires careful tuning. It might improve the score if tuned correctly.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost is straightforward to implement, handles categorical features natively, and is likely to improve the baseline score without complex preprocessing.",
