This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical data natively is advantageous. The LightGBM model performed slightly worse than the baseline, indicating that the preprocessing or hyperparameters might not have been optimal. Given the current results, it would be beneficial to further refine the CatBoost model or explore another model that can handle categorical data well.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost performed well, so tuning its hyperparameters might yield even better results.\n2. Try XGBoost with similar preprocessing as CatBoost \u2014 XGBoost is another powerful model that can handle categorical data with some preprocessing.\n3. Explore RandomForestRegressor with similar preprocessing \u2014 This model is robust and might provide a good baseline for comparison.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost already showed promising results, and refining it could lead to further improvements.",
