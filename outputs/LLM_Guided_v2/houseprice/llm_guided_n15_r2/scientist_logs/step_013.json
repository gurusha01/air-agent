For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the `cat_features` parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings first.",

  "memory_update": "Increasing the depth of CatBoost models can potentially capture more complex patterns, which might improve performance on this dataset.",
  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently outperformed other models in our attempts, with the best score achieved at node `root_0_1_0_6` using specific hyperparameters. The current best score is 0.9070, indicating that CatBoost is well-suited for this dataset. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, it is prudent to focus on refining the CatBoost model further with small hyperparameter adjustments to potentially improve the score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase the depth to 8 while keeping other parameters similar to node `root_0_1_0_6` \u2014 This might capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially improving the score.\n2. Increase the learning rate slightly to 0.013 with the same settings as node `root_0_1_0_6` \u2014 A slightly higher learning rate might speed up convergence and improve the score.\n3. Adjust the iterations to 2300 with a learning rate of 0.012 and depth of 6 \u2014 This could provide a balance between model complexity and convergence speed.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because increasing the depth could allow the model to capture more complex interactions in the data, which might lead to a better score given the dataset's characteristics.",
