This suggests that CatBoost's ability to handle categorical data natively is advantageous for this task. The LightGBM and XGBoost models did not perform as well, indicating that further exploration of CatBoost's hyperparameters might yield better results. We have not yet tried any models from the sklearn library, which could provide a useful comparison.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further optimize CatBoost by adjusting hyperparameters \u2014 This might work because CatBoost has shown the best performance so far, and fine-tuning could improve the score further.\n2. Try a RandomForestRegressor from sklearn \u2014 This might work as it is a robust model for regression tasks, and it would provide a good comparison to the boosting models already tried.\n3. Use a Ridge regression model from sklearn \u2014 This might work because it is simple and could provide a baseline comparison to more complex models.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has already shown strong performance, and further tuning could yield the best results.",
