The executor has successfully implemented CatBoost with various hyperparameters, indicating that further tuning could yield even better results. LightGBM and XGBoost have not surpassed CatBoost's performance. Given the remaining nodes, it is prudent to continue refining CatBoost.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further refine CatBoost by adjusting hyperparameters like learning_rate and depth \u2014 CatBoost has consistently performed well, and small adjustments could improve results.\n2. Try a different preprocessing strategy with CatBoost, such as scaling numeric features \u2014 This might enhance model performance by ensuring all features are on a similar scale.\n3. Explore a new model, such as RandomForest, to ensure diversity \u2014 While unlikely to outperform CatBoost, it provides a baseline for comparison.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has shown the best performance, and further tuning is likely to yield improvements.",
