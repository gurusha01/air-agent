  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently outperformed other models, with the best score achieved using specific hyperparameter settings. However, further tuning of CatBoost has shown diminishing returns. LightGBM and XGBoost have not performed as well, but XGBoost showed some promise. Given the limited nodes left, it's crucial to focus on refining the best-performing model, CatBoost, while also attempting a simple alternative approach to ensure robustness.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further refine CatBoost with slightly adjusted hyperparameters \u2014 This might yield a marginal improvement given its past success.\n2. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor with default settings \u2014 This provides a baseline for comparison and might capture different patterns.\n3. Revisit XGBoost with a slight hyperparameter tweak \u2014 XGBoost showed potential, and a minor adjustment might improve its score.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has consistently provided the best results, and further refinement might lead to a small but meaningful improvement.",
