  "direction": "Use CatBoost with the following settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6. For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies; instead, pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings before training.",

  "reasoning": "We are starting from scratch, so we have no previous nodes to analyze. Our goal is to improve upon the baseline score of 0.8800 using a simple and effective model. Given the executor's strengths, we should focus on models that are straightforward to implement and have a high likelihood of improving the baseline. CatBoost is a good candidate due to its ability to handle categorical features natively and its strong performance in regression tasks.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6 \u2014 CatBoost is known for handling categorical data well, and these hyperparameters are a good starting point for regression tasks.\n2. Use LightGBM with num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and performs well with large datasets, which might be beneficial here.\n3. Use XGBoost with max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 XGBoost is robust and often performs well in regression tasks, making it a solid choice.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features natively can simplify preprocessing and potentially improve performance over the baseline.",
