The CatBoost and LightGBM models failed due to issues with handling categorical features. The executor is capable of implementing simple models with clear preprocessing steps, and XGBoost has shown promise with straightforward preprocessing. \n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning \u2014 XGBoost performed well; slight hyperparameter adjustments might improve the score further.\n2. Try a RandomForestRegressor with simple preprocessing \u2014 Random forests can be robust and might offer a competitive score with minimal preprocessing.\n3. Use LightGBM again with corrected categorical feature handling \u2014 LightGBM can handle categorical features natively if set up correctly, but this carries some risk due to previous errors.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because XGBoost already showed good results, and refining it with hyperparameter tuning is likely to yield improvements without introducing new risks.",
