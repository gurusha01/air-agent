  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters improved the baseline score significantly. Given the executor's capabilities, leveraging models that handle categorical features directly is advantageous. We have not yet explored other model families like LightGBM or XGBoost, which are also well-suited for this task and can potentially yield better results. It's time to diversify our approach by trying a new model family while keeping the implementation simple.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with specific settings: num_boost_round=500, learning_rate=0.03, max_depth=6 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and can handle large datasets well. It might improve upon CatBoost's performance.\n2. Use XGBoost with specific settings: n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.03, max_depth=6 \u2014 XGBoost is known for its robustness and performance in regression tasks. It could potentially yield a better score.\n3. Refine the CatBoost model by adjusting hyperparameters: iterations=700, learning_rate=0.02, depth=7 \u2014 Further tuning CatBoost might squeeze out additional performance gains.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because LightGBM is efficient and can handle categorical features with minimal preprocessing, making it a good candidate for improving the score.",
