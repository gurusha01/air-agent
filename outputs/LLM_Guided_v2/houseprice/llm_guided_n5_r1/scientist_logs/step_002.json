  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters achieved a score of 0.9056, which is a significant improvement over the baseline. The LightGBM attempt failed due to an error with unseen labels, indicating an issue with categorical feature handling. CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly without extensive preprocessing is advantageous. We should explore another model family to ensure diversity and potentially improve the score further.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use XGBoost with specific hyperparameters \u2014 XGBoost is known for its performance in regression tasks and can handle missing values internally, which might improve the score.\n2. Refine CatBoost with slightly different hyperparameters \u2014 Since CatBoost performed well, a slight tweak might yield even better results.\n3. Use RandomForestRegressor from sklearn \u2014 A simple yet effective model that can provide a baseline comparison with tree-based methods.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because XGBoost is a strong candidate for regression tasks and can handle missing values, which might improve performance without complex preprocessing.",
