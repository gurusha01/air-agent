For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string type before training.",

  "reasoning": "We are starting from the baseline with no model execution. Our goal is to improve the R\u00b2 score beyond 0.8800. Given the executor's strengths, we should focus on models that are straightforward to implement and known for their performance in regression tasks, such as CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. We should also ensure that preprocessing is simple and effective.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6, and handle categorical features using the cat_features parameter \u2014 CatBoost is robust to categorical data and often performs well with minimal preprocessing.\n2. Use LightGBM with num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles large datasets well, which might improve the score.\n3. Use XGBoost with max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 XGBoost is a strong performer in many Kaggle competitions and could provide a good baseline improvement.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost can handle categorical features directly, which simplifies preprocessing and is likely to yield a good initial improvement.",
