  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently shown strong performance due to its native handling of categorical features, which simplifies preprocessing and reduces error risk. The LightGBM attempt failed due to unseen labels, likely because of inadequate preprocessing of categorical features. The XGBoost model performed decently but did not surpass CatBoost. We should continue refining CatBoost, as it has shown the best results so far.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase CatBoost iterations to 900 with a learning rate of 0.03 and depth of 6 \u2014 this might improve the score slightly by allowing the model to learn more patterns.\n2. Try a different model like RandomForest with n_estimators=500 and max_depth=10 \u2014 to explore a different model family and see if it can match or exceed CatBoost's performance.\n3. Use CatBoost with iterations=800, learning_rate=0.02, depth=7 \u2014 a slight variation in hyperparameters might yield better results.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing approach so far and has a high likelihood of improving the score with minimal risk.",
