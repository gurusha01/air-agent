For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Pass categorical features using the `cat_features` parameter in CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical variables to strings before training.",

  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model has consistently shown improvements with increased iterations, and it currently holds the best score. The LightGBM attempt failed due to unseen labels, indicating a preprocessing issue. The XGBoost model performed decently but not as well as CatBoost. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on refining the CatBoost model seems the most promising strategy.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase CatBoost iterations further to 1500 \u2014 This might continue the trend of incremental improvements seen with previous iteration increases.\n2. Adjust CatBoost learning rate to 0.02 with 1400 iterations \u2014 A slight learning rate reduction might stabilize training and improve performance.\n3. Try a simple RandomForestRegressor with default settings \u2014 Provides a fallback option with a different model family, though unlikely to outperform CatBoost.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because increasing CatBoost iterations has consistently improved performance, and this approach is likely to yield the best result within the remaining nodes.",
