  "reasoning": "Since this is the first attempt, we have no prior results to analyze. Given the executor's strengths, we should start with a simple and robust model that it can implement easily. CatBoost is a good choice because it handles categorical features natively, which simplifies preprocessing. We can set a reasonable number of iterations and learning rate to start with.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6 \u2014 CatBoost is robust to categorical data and requires minimal preprocessing, making it a good first choice.\n2. Use LightGBM with num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles large datasets well, but requires more preprocessing than CatBoost.\n3. Use XGBoost with max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 XGBoost is powerful but may require more careful handling of categorical data.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost handles categorical features natively, reducing the need for complex preprocessing, which aligns well with the executor's capabilities.",
