  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters performed well, achieving a score of 0.9066. The LightGBM attempt failed due to an error related to unseen labels, suggesting an issue with categorical handling or preprocessing. Since CatBoost handles categorical features natively, it simplifies preprocessing and reduces the risk of similar errors. Exploring another model family like XGBoost could provide additional insights while maintaining simplicity.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 It already performed well, and slight adjustments might improve the score further.\n2. Try XGBoost with specific hyperparameters \u2014 XGBoost is robust and might offer competitive performance with proper tuning.\n3. Retry LightGBM with improved preprocessing \u2014 Address the unseen labels issue and try again, as LightGBM is efficient for regression tasks.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because exploring XGBoost could provide a competitive alternative to CatBoost with minimal preprocessing complexity.",
