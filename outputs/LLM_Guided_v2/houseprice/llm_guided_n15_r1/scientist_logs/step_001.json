  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters has already improved the baseline score significantly. CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features natively reduces preprocessing complexity, which is beneficial given the executor's limitations. To further improve the score, we should explore other models that can be implemented easily by the executor, such as LightGBM or XGBoost, which are known for their performance in regression tasks. Additionally, we can refine the CatBoost model with different hyperparameters to see if further improvements can be achieved.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with specific hyperparameters \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and can handle large datasets well, which might improve the score further.\n2. Refine the CatBoost model by adjusting hyperparameters \u2014 Further tuning CatBoost might yield a better score since it already performed well.\n3. Use XGBoost with specific hyperparameters \u2014 XGBoost is another powerful gradient boosting model that could potentially outperform the current best score.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because LightGBM is efficient and often performs well in regression tasks, and it provides a good balance between exploration and potential improvement.",
