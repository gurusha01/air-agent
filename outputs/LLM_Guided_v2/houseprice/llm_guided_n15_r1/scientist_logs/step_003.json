The LightGBM attempt failed due to unseen labels, suggesting a preprocessing oversight. XGBoost performed well but not as well as CatBoost. Given the remaining nodes, it's prudent to refine the CatBoost approach further to maximize the score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost performed best, so small tweaks could yield improvements.\n2. Try LightGBM again with corrected preprocessing \u2014 Fixing the unseen labels issue might lead to a successful run.\n3. Use RandomForestRegressor from sklearn \u2014 A different model family that the executor can handle, offering diversity.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost already showed the best performance, and refining it could lead to further improvements.",
