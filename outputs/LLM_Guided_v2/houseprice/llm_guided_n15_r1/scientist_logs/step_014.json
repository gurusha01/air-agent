Ensure all categorical columns are cast to string before fitting the model.",

  "memory_update": "Increasing CatBoost iterations continues to yield incremental improvements in model performance.",
  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with increasing iterations has consistently improved performance, reaching a score of 0.9120. This suggests that further increasing iterations might yield additional gains. The LightGBM attempt failed due to unseen labels, indicating a preprocessing oversight. The XGBoost approach performed worse than CatBoost. Given the limited actions left, focusing on refining the best-performing CatBoost model is the most promising strategy.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase CatBoost iterations to 1600 \u2014 This might further improve the score as previous increases have shown positive results.\n2. Try a different learning rate with CatBoost \u2014 This could potentially fine-tune the model's performance.\n3. Use a different model family (e.g., LightGBM) with corrected preprocessing \u2014 Risky due to potential preprocessing issues and limited actions.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because increasing iterations in CatBoost has consistently yielded improvements, and it's a straightforward change that the executor can implement without introducing new complexities.",
