  "memory_update": "LightGBM could offer a more straightforward implementation with its handling of categorical features, potentially improving over the baseline.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts with CatBoost failed due to incorrect specification of categorical features by index rather than by name. This suggests that while CatBoost is promising, we need to ensure proper handling of categorical features. We haven't yet explored other model families, which could provide a different perspective and potentially better results.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with early stopping and hyperparameters: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles categorical features well if specified correctly, which might improve over the baseline.\n2. Use XGBoost with hyperparameters: max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 XGBoost is robust and might perform well with proper preprocessing.\n3. Retry CatBoost with correct categorical feature specification by name \u2014 If implemented correctly, CatBoost could still outperform the baseline due to its native handling of categorical data.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because LightGBM is efficient, handles categorical features well, and offers a good balance between performance and ease of implementation.",
