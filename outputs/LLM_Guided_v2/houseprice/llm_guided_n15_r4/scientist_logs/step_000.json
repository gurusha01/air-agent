For preprocessing, fill numeric NaN values with the median and drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical features to strings before training.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that categorical features are correctly identified and passed to the CatBoost model using the cat_features parameter. If you encounter any dtype issues, convert categorical columns to strings. Avoid using get_dummies as it can increase memory usage unnecessarily.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features natively can simplify preprocessing and potentially improve performance over the baseline.",
  "reasoning": "We are starting from the baseline score of 0.8800 with no model execution yet. Our goal is to improve this score using models that the executor can handle, such as CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, or simple sklearn models. Given the executor's strengths, we should focus on straightforward implementations with clear preprocessing steps. \n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6 \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features well and is robust to missing data, which might give a good initial improvement.\n2. Use LightGBM with num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and often performs well on structured data.\n3. Use XGBoost with n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6 \u2014 XGBoost is a strong performer in many Kaggle competitions and might provide a good boost over the baseline.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost can handle categorical features natively, which simplifies preprocessing and might lead to a quick improvement over the baseline.",
