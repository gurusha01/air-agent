The probabilistic approach (root_1) underperformed, suggesting that randomness alone isn't effective against this opponent.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Implement a strategy that starts with 0 for the first two rounds, then switches to tit-for-tat. This might work because it establishes a pattern the opponent is likely to copy, allowing us to exploit their copying tendency.\n2. Use a strategy that alternates between 0 and 1 every two rounds. This could confuse the opponent's copying strategy, potentially leading to higher payoffs.\n3. Develop a strategy that uses a weighted random choice favoring 0 more heavily than 1, adapting based on the opponent's last move. This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy while still favoring our preferred outcome.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the successful tit-for-tat strategy while establishing an initial pattern that could be beneficial.",
