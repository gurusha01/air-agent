This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move with 80% probability. The current score is 1.0964, which is an improvement over the baseline. To further improve, we can explore variations that exploit the opponent's copying behavior more effectively.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 for three rounds, then mimic the opponent \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency more effectively by creating a longer pattern.\n2. Alternate between moves 0 and 1 for the first four rounds, then mimic the opponent \u2014 This introduces a predictable pattern that might confuse the opponent's copying strategy.\n3. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 if the opponent copies, otherwise continue with 0 \u2014 This adaptive strategy could exploit the opponent's copying behavior dynamically.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the current best strategy by extending the pattern, which might better exploit the opponent's copying behavior.",
