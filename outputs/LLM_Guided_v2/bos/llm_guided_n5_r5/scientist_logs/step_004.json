This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, which has been effective so far. To further improve, we can try extending the initial sequence of moves or adjusting the pattern to maximize our payoff.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0 for the first five rounds, then switch to move 1 for the next three rounds, and mimic the opponent's last move \u2014 This might further exploit the opponent's copying behavior by establishing a stronger initial pattern.\n2. Alternate between moves 0 and 1 for the first four rounds, then mimic the opponent's last move \u2014 This could confuse the opponent initially and then capitalize on their copying tendency.\n3. Start with move 0 for the first three rounds, switch to move 1 for the next four rounds, and then mimic the opponent's last move \u2014 This might balance between establishing a pattern and exploiting the opponent's behavior.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because extending the initial sequence of move 0 could further exploit the opponent's tendency to copy, potentially leading to higher payoffs.",
