This indicates that exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy our last move is beneficial. However, there might be room for improvement by introducing a more sophisticated pattern that takes advantage of the opponent's behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This might confuse the opponent and exploit their tendency to copy our last move.\n2. Start with 0, then switch to 1 for two rounds, then mimic \u2014 This could establish a pattern that maximizes our payoff by leveraging the opponent's copying behavior.\n3. Use a probabilistic approach: 70% chance to choose 0, 30% to choose 1 \u2014 This introduces randomness that might disrupt the opponent's strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it introduces a pattern that could potentially maximize our payoff by exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy moves.",
