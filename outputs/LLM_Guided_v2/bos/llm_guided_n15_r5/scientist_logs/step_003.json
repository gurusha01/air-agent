  "reasoning": "The strategy of starting with a consistent pattern before switching to tit-for-tat has shown promise. Extending the initial consistent pattern to three rounds improved the score, suggesting that establishing a predictable pattern early on can influence the opponent's behavior beneficially.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0 for the first four rounds, then switch to a tit-for-tat approach \u2014 This might further solidify the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, potentially increasing our payoff.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 for the first four rounds, then switch to tit-for-tat \u2014 This could confuse the opponent initially but might establish a pattern they follow, leading to a better payoff.\n3. Use a probabilistic approach where we play 0 with a 70% probability for the first three rounds, then switch to tit-for-tat \u2014 This could introduce variability that might disrupt the opponent's copying strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because extending the initial consistent pattern to four rounds has the potential to further influence the opponent's behavior in a way that benefits our preferred strategy.",
