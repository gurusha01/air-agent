  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting by cooperating (returning 0) and then using a tit-for-tat approach yielded a score improvement over the baseline. This suggests that leveraging the opponent's tendency to copy our last move is beneficial. However, there may be room for improvement by refining the strategy to better exploit the opponent's behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This might confuse the opponent's copying strategy and could potentially lead to more favorable outcomes.\n2. Start with 0 for the first two rounds, then switch to tit-for-tat \u2014 This could establish a pattern that the opponent might follow, giving us an advantage in the initial rounds.\n3. Use a probabilistic approach: 70% chance to play 0, 30% to play 1 \u2014 This introduces randomness that might disrupt the opponent's copying strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it builds on the successful tit-for-tat strategy while potentially gaining an early advantage by establishing a pattern.",
