  "reasoning": "We haven't yet attempted any strategies, so there are no past successes or failures to analyze. The task requires us to maximize our payoff in an iterated Battle of Sexes game where the opponent tends to copy our last move with an 80% probability. The baseline score is 1.0227, and our goal is to exceed this.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Tit-for-Tat with Initial Cooperation \u2014 Start with strategy 0, then copy the opponent's last move. This leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our move.\n2. Randomized Strategy \u2014 Start with strategy 0, then randomly choose between 0 and 1 with a bias towards 0. This introduces unpredictability while still favoring our preferred outcome.\n3. Pattern Recognition \u2014 Analyze the opponent's responses to our moves and attempt to predict their next move to maximize our payoff.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it is simple, aligns well with the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, and is straightforward for the executor to implement within 100 lines.",
