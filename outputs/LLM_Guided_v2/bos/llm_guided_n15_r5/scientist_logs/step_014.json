This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, leading to a higher average payoff. The previous attempts to introduce variability or switch strategies have not yielded better results.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Consistently play 0 for all ten rounds \u2014 This has proven to be the most effective strategy so far, exploiting the opponent's copying behavior.\n2. Introduce a small probability of playing 1 in the last two rounds \u2014 This could potentially exploit the opponent's copying behavior, but previous attempts have not improved the score.\n3. Start with a mixed strategy of playing 0 and 1 in the first few rounds, then switch to consistently playing 0 \u2014 This might confuse the opponent initially, but it risks deviating from the successful strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it has consistently achieved the highest score and aligns with the executor's capabilities.",
