  "reasoning": "The strategy of consistently playing 0 for all ten rounds has yielded the highest score so far. This approach exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, maximizing our payoff since the opponent often plays 0 in response. This strategy is simple and effective given the opponent's behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Continue playing 0 for all ten rounds \u2014 This strategy has shown the best results, leveraging the opponent's tendency to copy our moves.\n2. Introduce a small probability of playing 1 in the last two rounds \u2014 This could potentially exploit any unexpected changes in the opponent's behavior, but carries risk.\n3. Start with a mixed strategy (e.g., alternating 0 and 1) \u2014 This might confuse the opponent but is less likely to consistently maximize our payoff given the opponent's copying behavior.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it has consistently provided the best score by exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy our moves.",
