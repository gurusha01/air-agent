This approach exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move with an 80% probability, maximizing our payoff when both players choose 0. The consistent strategy has been refined to achieve a score of 1.4423, which is the best outcome observed.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a small probability of playing 1 in the last round \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying behavior and slightly increase our payoff.\n2. Continue with the strategy of consistently playing 0 for all ten rounds \u2014 This has been the most successful strategy so far.\n3. Start with a mixed strategy for the first few rounds, then switch to consistently playing 0 \u2014 This could potentially confuse the opponent initially and then exploit their copying behavior.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it has consistently yielded the highest score and is straightforward for the executor to implement.",
