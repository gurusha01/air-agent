  "reasoning": "The previous strategies have shown that starting with a consistent pattern before switching to a tit-for-tat approach can be beneficial. The best score so far was achieved by playing 0 for the first two rounds and then switching to a tit-for-tat strategy. This suggests that establishing an initial pattern can influence the opponent's behavior in a favorable way.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0 for the first three rounds, then switch to tit-for-tat \u2014 This might further reinforce the initial pattern and exploit the opponent's tendency to copy.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 for the first four rounds, then switch to tit-for-tat \u2014 This could confuse the opponent initially but might lead to a more predictable pattern later.\n3. Play 0 for the first round, then switch to a probabilistic strategy where 0 is played with 70% probability \u2014 This introduces some randomness which might be beneficial against an opponent that tends to copy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because extending the initial consistent pattern to three rounds might further solidify the opponent's tendency to copy, potentially leading to a higher payoff.",
