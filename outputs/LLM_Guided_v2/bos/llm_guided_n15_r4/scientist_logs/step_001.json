  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting with 0 and then copying the opponent's last move achieved a score of 1.0763, which is better than the baseline. This suggests that leveraging the opponent's tendency to copy our last move is beneficial. However, there might be room for improvement by incorporating a more nuanced approach to exploit the opponent's behavior further.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This might confuse the opponent and exploit their tendency to copy our last move, potentially leading to a higher payoff.\n2. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move, and revert to 0 if they don't \u2014 This strategy tries to exploit the opponent's copying behavior more directly.\n3. Use a probabilistic approach: start with 0, then choose 0 with 70% probability and 1 with 30% probability \u2014 This introduces randomness, which might disrupt the opponent's copying pattern.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it directly exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, potentially leading to a higher payoff by switching to the opponent's preferred strategy when they copy us.",
