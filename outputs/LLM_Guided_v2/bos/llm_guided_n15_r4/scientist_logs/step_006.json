  "reasoning": "The current best-performing strategy involves starting with 0 and then adapting based on the opponent's behavior. The opponent tends to copy our last move with an 80% probability, so strategies that exploit this tendency have shown promise. The best score so far was achieved by starting with 0 and then switching strategies based on the opponent's copying behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move twice in a row, and return to 0 if they don't copy our switch \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency effectively.\n2. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move three times in a row, and return to 0 if they don't copy our switch \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's copying tendency.\n3. Start with 0, and switch to 1 every third round regardless of the opponent's move \u2014 This introduces a predictable pattern that might confuse the opponent's copying strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves and has a clear decision rule that the executor can implement.",
