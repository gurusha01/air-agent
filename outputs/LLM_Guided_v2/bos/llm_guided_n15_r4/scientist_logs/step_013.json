This approach effectively exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, which aligns with the task's requirements. The variations that switched to 1 earlier or alternated moves did not perform as well, indicating that a more patient approach to exploiting the opponent's behavior is beneficial.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0 and switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move four times in a row \u2014 This might further exploit the opponent's copying tendency while maintaining a stable strategy.\n2. Start with move 0 and switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move three times in a row, then switch back to 0 after two rounds \u2014 This could balance exploitation and stability.\n3. Start with move 0 and switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move three times in a row, then alternate between 0 and 1 \u2014 This might introduce variability to confuse the opponent.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the successful strategy by extending the exploitation phase, which has shown potential for higher payoffs.",
