  "direction": "Write a strategy that starts by choosing 0. If the opponent copies our move three times in a row, switch to 1 and stay on 1 for three rounds before switching back to 0. This approach aims to exploit the opponent's copying tendency and their preference for strategy 1.",

  "reasoning": "The current best-performing strategy involves starting with 0 and switching to 1 after the opponent copies our move three times in a row. This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, which aligns with their preference for strategy 1. However, the improvement is marginal, indicating room for further optimization.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, switch to 1 after two consecutive copies, then back to 0 \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency more aggressively.\n2. Start with 0, switch to 1 after three consecutive copies, then alternate every two rounds \u2014 This could balance exploitation and unpredictability.\n3. Start with 0, switch to 1 after three consecutive copies, then stay on 1 for three rounds before switching back \u2014 This might maximize payoff by aligning with the opponent's preference longer.\n\nCHOSEN: 3 because it leverages the opponent's preference for 1 more effectively, potentially increasing our score by maintaining alignment longer.",
