  "reasoning": "The strategy that started by choosing 0 and then copied the opponent's last move performed better than the baseline, indicating that exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy can be beneficial. However, the attempt to refine this strategy by checking if the opponent copied our move resulted in a lower score. The alternating strategy did not perform well, likely because it did not effectively exploit the opponent's copying tendency.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move twice in a row \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency by switching to their preferred strategy when they are likely to follow.\n2. Start with 0, then use a probabilistic approach to switch to 1 with a 20% chance \u2014 This could introduce unpredictability while still leveraging the opponent's copying tendency.\n3. Start with 0, then switch to 1 every third round \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy by introducing a predictable pattern that aligns with their preference.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly leverages the opponent's copying tendency while aligning with their preference when they are likely to follow.",
