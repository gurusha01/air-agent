  "reasoning": "The strategy that achieved the highest score involved starting with move 0 and switching to move 1 after the opponent copied our move three times in a row. This approach takes advantage of the opponent's tendency to mimic our last move, thereby maximizing our payoff when they are likely to continue copying. The strategy also included staying on move 1 for two rounds, which seemed to slightly improve the score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 after the opponent copies our move three times in a row, and stay on move 1 for two rounds \u2014 This strategy has already yielded the highest score so far.\n2. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 after the opponent copies our move four times in a row, and stay on move 1 for two rounds \u2014 This might further exploit the opponent's copying behavior.\n3. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 after the opponent copies our move three times in a row, and stay on move 1 for three rounds \u2014 Extending the exploitation phase might increase the score.\n\nCHOSEN: 3 because extending the exploitation phase might further increase the score by taking advantage of the opponent's copying tendency.",
