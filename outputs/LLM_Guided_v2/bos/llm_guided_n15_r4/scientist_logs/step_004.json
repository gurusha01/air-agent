  "reasoning": "The current best strategy (root_0) starts by choosing 0 and then copies the opponent's last move. This takes advantage of the opponent's tendency to copy our last move. However, it might not fully exploit situations where the opponent consistently copies us, allowing us to switch to their preferred strategy (1) to maximize our payoff when they copy us.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies us twice in a row \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency better by aligning with their preference when they are likely to follow.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 every three rounds, starting with 0 \u2014 This could introduce unpredictability and exploit the opponent's copying tendency.\n3. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies us in the first round \u2014 This might capitalize on the opponent's immediate copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it leverages the opponent's tendency to copy us twice, potentially maximizing our payoff by aligning with their preference when they are likely to follow.",
