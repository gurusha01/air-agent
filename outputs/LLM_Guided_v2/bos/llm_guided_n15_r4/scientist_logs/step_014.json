  "reasoning": "The strategy that achieved the highest score involved starting with move 0 and switching to move 1 after the opponent copied our move four times in a row. This strategy effectively exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, allowing us to align with their preferred strategy for a longer period, which maximizes our payoff.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 after the opponent copies our move four times in a row \u2014 This approach has already shown the highest score, indicating its effectiveness.\n2. Start with move 0, switch to move 1 after the opponent copies our move three times in a row, and stay on 1 for two rounds \u2014 This approach might exploit the opponent's copying tendency earlier but has not performed as well as candidate 1.\n3. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds, starting with 0 \u2014 This approach did not perform well, likely because it doesn't fully exploit the opponent's copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it has already shown the highest score and effectively exploits the opponent's copying tendency.",
