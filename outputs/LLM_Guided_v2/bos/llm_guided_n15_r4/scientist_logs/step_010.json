  "reasoning": "The strategy that starts by choosing 0 and then switches to 1 after the opponent copies our move three times in a row has shown the best score so far (1.2325). This approach exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, allowing us to maximize our payoff by aligning with their preferred strategy after establishing a pattern. However, further improvements might be possible by fine-tuning the switch timing or extending the exploitation phase.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Extend the exploitation phase after switching to 1 \u2014 This might increase the payoff by maintaining alignment with the opponent's preferred strategy for longer.\n2. Switch to 1 after the opponent copies our move four times in a row \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's copying tendency by recognizing a longer pattern.\n3. Alternate between 0 and 1 every three rounds, starting with 0 \u2014 A different approach that might confuse the opponent's copying strategy and increase our score.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because extending the exploitation phase after switching to 1 has the potential to increase the payoff by maintaining alignment with the opponent's preferred strategy for a longer period, which has shown to be effective in previous strategies.",
