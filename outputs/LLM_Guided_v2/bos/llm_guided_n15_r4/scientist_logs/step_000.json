The task involves creating a strategy for the Battle of Sexes game where the opponent tends to copy our last move with an 80% probability. Our goal is to maximize our payoff by choosing strategy 0 as often as possible, given that our opponent prefers strategy 1.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Tit-for-tat strategy \u2014 Start with 0, then copy the opponent's last move. This leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our move.\n2. Randomized strategy \u2014 Start with 0, then randomly choose between 0 and 1 with a bias towards 0, considering the opponent's copying tendency.\n3. Alternating strategy \u2014 Alternate between 0 and 1 to confuse the opponent and capitalize on their copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, which aligns with our preference for strategy 0.",
