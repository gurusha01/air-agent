  "reasoning": "The best-performing strategy so far is the one that starts by choosing 0 and then copies the opponent's last move. This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, which aligns with our preference for strategy 0. However, there is room for improvement by incorporating more sophisticated patterns that exploit the opponent's behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Implement a strategy that starts with 0, then switches to 1 if the opponent copies our move twice in a row, otherwise return to 0. This could exploit the opponent's copying tendency more effectively.\n2. Develop a strategy that starts with 0 and alternates between 0 and 1 every two rounds, but switches to 1 if the opponent copies our move. This might exploit the opponent's copying behavior while maintaining unpredictability.\n3. Create a strategy that starts with 0, then copies the opponent's last move, but switches to 1 if the opponent copies us three times consecutively. This could take advantage of the opponent's strong copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing strategy by adding a conditional switch that could exploit the opponent's copying behavior more effectively.",
