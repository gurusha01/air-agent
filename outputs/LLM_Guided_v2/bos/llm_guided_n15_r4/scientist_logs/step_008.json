  "reasoning": "The current best score is 1.2314, achieved by exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy our moves by switching to strategy 1 after the opponent copies our move three times in a row. This approach leverages the opponent's predictable behavior to maximize our payoff. Other strategies that did not perform well either failed to exploit the opponent's copying behavior effectively or were too simplistic.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with strategy 0, switch to 1 after the opponent copies our move twice in a row, then switch back to 0 after one round \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's tendency to copy while maintaining our preferred strategy.\n2. Use a probabilistic approach: start with 0, then choose 1 with a 20% probability if the opponent copies our move twice in a row \u2014 This introduces randomness, potentially confusing the opponent's strategy.\n3. Start with strategy 0, and if the opponent copies our move three times in a row, switch to 1 for two rounds, then revert to 0 \u2014 This builds on the current best strategy by extending the exploitation phase.\n\nCHOSEN: 3 because it builds on the current best strategy and might further increase the payoff by extending the exploitation phase when the opponent is likely to follow.",
