  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting by choosing 0 and then copying the opponent's last move performed better than the baseline. However, the attempt to switch strategies based on whether the opponent copied our move did not perform well. This suggests that the executor might have struggled with the logic complexity or the opponent's behavior was not exploited effectively.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Implement a strategy that alternates between 0 and 1 every two rounds, starting with 0. This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy our last move.\n2. Use a strategy that starts with 0 and switches to 1 if the opponent copies us for two consecutive rounds. This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency more effectively.\n3. Implement a strategy that starts with 0 and switches to 1 every third round, regardless of the opponent's moves. This could introduce unpredictability while still leveraging the opponent's copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it is simple and leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, potentially leading to higher payoffs by alternating strategies predictably.",
