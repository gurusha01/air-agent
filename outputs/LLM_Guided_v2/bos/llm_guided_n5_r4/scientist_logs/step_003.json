  "reasoning": "The previous attempts have shown that exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy moves can be beneficial. The best-performing strategy so far involved starting with a move and then adapting based on the opponent's behavior. However, introducing probabilistic elements to the strategy might better exploit the opponent's tendency to copy moves.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, then use a probabilistic approach where if the opponent's last move was 0, return 0 with 80% probability; otherwise, return 1 \u2014 This leverages the opponent's tendency to copy moves.\n2. Start with move 0, then switch to move 1 if the opponent copies our move twice in a row, and return to move 0 after one round \u2014 This attempts to create a predictable pattern for the opponent to copy.\n3. Alternate between moves 0 and 1 every two rounds, regardless of the opponent's move \u2014 This introduces a predictable pattern that might confuse the opponent's copying strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly exploits the opponent's tendency to copy moves with a probabilistic approach, which aligns with the opponent's behavior and has a higher chance of success.",
