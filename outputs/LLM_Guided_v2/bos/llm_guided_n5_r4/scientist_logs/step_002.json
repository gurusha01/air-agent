  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting with 0 and then copying the opponent's last move showed improvement over the baseline, indicating that leveraging the opponent's tendency to copy can be beneficial. However, the subsequent attempt to introduce probabilistic behavior based on the opponent's last move resulted in a lower score, suggesting that the randomness introduced was not effective.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Implement a strategy that starts with 0, then alternates between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's tendency to copy by creating a predictable pattern that maximizes our payoff.\n2. Use a strategy that starts with 0, then switches to 1 if the opponent copies our move twice in a row \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's copying behavior by forcing them into a pattern that benefits us.\n3. Implement a strategy that starts with 0, then uses a probabilistic approach to switch to 1 with a 30% chance if the opponent's last move was 1 \u2014 This might introduce enough unpredictability to exploit the opponent's copying tendency while still favoring our preferred strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it directly leverages the opponent's copying behavior to create a predictable pattern that could maximize our payoff.",
