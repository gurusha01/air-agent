  "reasoning": "The previous best strategy (Node root_1) achieved a score of 1.3701 by starting with 0 and then copying the opponent's last move but switching to 0 with a probability. This approach effectively exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move. However, we can explore further refinements or alternative strategies to see if we can achieve an even higher score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then use a probabilistic approach where we choose 0 with a higher probability if the opponent chose 0 in the last round, and choose 1 with a higher probability if the opponent chose 1 in the last round. This might better exploit the opponent's tendency to copy our last move.\n2. Start with 0, then use a mixed strategy where we choose 0 with a probability of 0.7 and 1 with a probability of 0.3, regardless of the opponent's last move. This could introduce enough randomness to confuse the opponent's copying strategy.\n3. Start with 0, then alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds. This might introduce a pattern that the opponent could start copying, allowing us to exploit it in the later rounds.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly leverages the opponent's copying behavior while maintaining a focus on maximizing our preferred outcome.",
