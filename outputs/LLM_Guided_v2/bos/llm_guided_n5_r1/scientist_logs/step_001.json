  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting with 0 and then choosing 0 if the opponent chose 0 in the last round did not perform well. This approach was too simplistic and did not effectively exploit the opponent's tendency to copy our last move with an 80% probability. We need a strategy that better leverages this tendency to maximize our payoff.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then use a probabilistic approach: choose 0 with a high probability if the opponent chose 0 last round, otherwise choose 1 \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy our last move while still allowing for some unpredictability.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds, starting with 0 \u2014 This might confuse the opponent and take advantage of their copying tendency, but it risks not maximizing our preferred outcome.\n3. Use a tit-for-tat strategy with a twist: start with 0, then copy the opponent's last move but switch to 0 with a 70% probability \u2014 This leverages the opponent's copying tendency while still favoring our preferred outcome.\n\nCHOSEN: 3 because it balances exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy with favoring our preferred outcome, and is simple enough for the executor to implement.",
