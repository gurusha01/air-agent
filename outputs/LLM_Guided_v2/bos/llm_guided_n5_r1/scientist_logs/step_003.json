  "reasoning": "The previous attempts showed that incorporating probabilistic elements into the strategy can exploit the opponent's tendency to copy our last move. The best-performing strategy so far (Node root_1) involved starting with 0 and then copying the opponent's last move but switching to 0 with a certain probability. This approach yielded a score of 1.3701, which is better than the baseline.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then copy the opponent's last move, but switch to 0 with a 70% probability if the opponent chose 1 last time \u2014 This might further exploit the opponent's copying tendency while increasing our chances of achieving our preferred outcome.\n2. Start with 0, then use a weighted random choice based on the opponent's last move (e.g., 0.7 probability for 0 if they chose 0, 0.3 if they chose 1) \u2014 This introduces more randomness, potentially confusing the opponent's strategy.\n3. Start with 0, then always choose 0 if the opponent chose 1 in the last two rounds \u2014 This could exploit a pattern where the opponent might switch strategies after consecutive losses.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing strategy so far by adjusting the probability of switching to our preferred outcome, potentially increasing our score.",
