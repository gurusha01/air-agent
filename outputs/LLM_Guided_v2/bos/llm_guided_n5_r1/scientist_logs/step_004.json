This leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move while increasing the chances of achieving our preferred outcome.",

  "reasoning": "The best-performing strategy so far involves starting with a move of 0 and then copying the opponent's last move but switching to 0 with a certain probability. This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our last move. The slight improvement in score suggests that introducing probabilistic elements can further enhance the strategy. However, the improvement was minimal, indicating that further refinement is needed.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then copy the opponent's last move but switch to 0 with a 70% probability if the opponent chose 1 \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying tendency better by increasing the likelihood of reaching our preferred outcome.\n2. Start with 0, then alternate between copying the opponent's last move and choosing 0 \u2014 This introduces a more structured probabilistic element, which might confuse the opponent's strategy.\n3. Start with 0, then choose 0 with a 60% probability regardless of the opponent's last move \u2014 This simplifies the strategy and might better exploit the opponent's tendency to copy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing strategy so far and introduces a more aggressive probabilistic element that might better exploit the opponent's copying tendency.",
