  "reasoning": "The best-performing strategy so far involves starting with move 0 and switching to move 1 if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds. This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, thereby maximizing our payoff. The strategy that introduces a probabilistic element to disrupt the opponent's copying pattern has also shown potential but hasn't surpassed the best score yet.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic element where we start with move 0, and after two consecutive rounds of the opponent copying, switch to move 1 with a 70% probability \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's predictability while maintaining our preferred strategy.\n2. Start with move 0, and if the opponent copies our move for two rounds, switch to move 1 for one round, then revert to move 0 \u2014 This approach could introduce unpredictability and potentially improve our score.\n3. Start with move 0, and after two consecutive rounds of the opponent copying, switch to move 1 with a 50% probability \u2014 This balances between exploiting the opponent's copying behavior and maintaining our strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds upon the best-performing strategy and introduces a probabilistic element that could enhance our score by exploiting the opponent's predictability.",
