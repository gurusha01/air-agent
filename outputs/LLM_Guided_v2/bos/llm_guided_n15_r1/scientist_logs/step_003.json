  "reasoning": "The initial strategy that involved starting with move 0 and then copying the opponent's last move showed some improvement over the baseline. However, the subsequent attempts to introduce randomness or conditional strategies did not yield better results. The opponent's tendency to copy our last move suggests that a strategy exploiting this behavior could be beneficial.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, then continue with move 0 if the opponent copied our last move. If the opponent did not copy, switch to move 1 for one round before reverting to move 0 \u2014 This exploits the opponent's copying behavior while introducing a minor disruption.\n2. Alternate between moves 0 and 1 every two rounds, starting with move 0 \u2014 This could disrupt the opponent's copying pattern and potentially lead to more favorable outcomes.\n3. Start with move 0, then use a probabilistic approach: with a 70% chance, repeat the last move; with a 30% chance, switch moves \u2014 This introduces randomness to exploit the opponent's copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves while introducing a simple disruption that could lead to higher payoffs.",
