  "reasoning": "The best-performing strategy so far involves starting with move 0 and switching to move 1 if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds. This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our moves, allowing us to exploit their predictability. The slight variations in this strategy have shown different levels of success, with some achieving scores above 1.4.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Modify the best strategy by introducing a probabilistic switch back to move 0 after the opponent copies move 1 for two rounds \u2014 this might catch the opponent off guard and increase our payoff.\n2. Start with move 0, and if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds, switch to move 1 for two rounds, then revert to move 0 \u2014 this could exploit the opponent's copying behavior while maintaining a focus on our preferred strategy.\n3. Start with move 0, and introduce a random element where we switch to move 1 with a 20% probability after the opponent copies our move \u2014 this could disrupt the opponent's copying pattern.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing strategy by adding a probabilistic element that could further exploit the opponent's predictability.",
