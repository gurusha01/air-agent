  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting with move 0 and then copying the opponent's last move (Tit-for-Tat) yielded a better score than the baseline. However, introducing randomness in the subsequent strategy did not improve the score, likely because it disrupted the predictability that the opponent's strategy relies on. Since the opponent tends to copy our last move with an 80% probability, a strategy that leverages this tendency while maintaining our preference for move 0 could be effective.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, and if the opponent copies, continue with move 0. If the opponent deviates, switch to move 1 for one round, then return to 0 \u2014 This leverages the opponent's copying tendency while occasionally disrupting their pattern.\n2. Alternate between moves 0 and 1 every two rounds, regardless of the opponent's move \u2014 This introduces a predictable pattern that might exploit the opponent's copying behavior.\n3. Start with move 0, and if the opponent deviates from copying, switch to move 1 for two rounds, then return to 0 \u2014 This strategy could exploit the opponent's deviation by maximizing our payoff when they don't copy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it maintains a focus on our preferred strategy while introducing a minor disruption to the opponent's copying pattern, potentially maximizing our payoff.",
