  "reasoning": "The current best-performing strategy involves starting with move 0 and then switching strategies based on the opponent's behavior over multiple rounds. This approach effectively exploits the opponent's tendency to copy moves. However, there is room for improvement by further refining the conditions under which we switch strategies.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a more nuanced probabilistic switch: Start with move 0, and if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds, switch to move 1 with a 50% probability, otherwise continue with move 0. \u2014 This might work because it introduces uncertainty, potentially disrupting the opponent's copying pattern.\n2. Implement a memory-based strategy: Start with move 0, and if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds, switch to move 1 for the next two rounds before reverting to move 0. \u2014 This could work by creating a pattern that the opponent might struggle to copy effectively.\n3. Use a dynamic adjustment strategy: Start with move 0, and based on the opponent's last two moves, adjust our strategy dynamically to maximize our payoff. \u2014 This might work by adapting to the opponent's behavior more effectively, but it risks being too complex for the executor.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it introduces a probabilistic element that can disrupt the opponent's copying pattern while being simple enough for the executor to implement.",
