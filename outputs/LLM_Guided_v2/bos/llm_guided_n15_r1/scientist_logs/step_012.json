  "reasoning": "The best-performing strategy so far involves starting with move 0 and switching to move 1 if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds. This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to mimic our moves, allowing us to exploit their predictability. However, further improvements might be possible by introducing a probabilistic element to disrupt the opponent's copying pattern or by refining the conditions under which we switch strategies.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic switch: Start with move 0, and if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds, switch to move 1 with a 70% probability. This could exploit the opponent's predictability while maintaining some unpredictability.\n2. Refine the switch condition: Start with move 0, and switch to move 1 if the opponent copies our move for three consecutive rounds. This could better exploit their copying behavior by ensuring a stronger pattern before switching.\n3. Alternate strategy: Start with move 0, and alternate between moves 0 and 1 every two rounds. This could introduce unpredictability and disrupt the opponent's copying pattern.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it balances exploiting the opponent's predictability with maintaining some unpredictability, which could lead to higher payoffs.",
