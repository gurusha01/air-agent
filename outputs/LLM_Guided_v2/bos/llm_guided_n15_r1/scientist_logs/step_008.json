  "reasoning": "The best-performing strategy so far is Node root_0_4_0, which starts by choosing move 0 and switches to move 1 if the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds. This strategy exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves while introducing a strategic switch to disrupt their pattern. The executor has successfully implemented this strategy, achieving a score of 1.4391.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic switch after two consecutive copies \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's predictability by adding randomness.\n2. Use a fixed pattern switch after three consecutive copies \u2014 This might stabilize the strategy by introducing a predictable switch after a longer pattern.\n3. Alternate moves every three rounds regardless of history \u2014 This could introduce a consistent pattern that might confuse the opponent's strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing strategy and introduces a probabilistic element that could further exploit the opponent's predictable behavior.",
