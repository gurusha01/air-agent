  "reasoning": "The best performing strategy so far is Node root_0_4_0, which introduces a strategic switch based on the opponent's behavior over multiple rounds. This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our moves while introducing a controlled disruption to their pattern. The strategy of switching moves after the opponent copies our move for two consecutive rounds has shown significant improvement in our score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a strategy that starts with move 0 and switches to move 1 if the opponent copies our move for three consecutive rounds \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's predictability.\n2. Use a strategy that alternates between moves 0 and 1 every two rounds, regardless of the opponent's behavior \u2014 This might introduce enough randomness to disrupt the opponent's strategy.\n3. Implement a strategy that starts with move 0 and switches to move 1 if the opponent does not copy our move for two consecutive rounds \u2014 This could exploit situations where the opponent deviates from their copying pattern.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the successful approach of Node root_0_4_0 by extending the observation period to three rounds, potentially allowing us to better exploit the opponent's copying behavior.",
