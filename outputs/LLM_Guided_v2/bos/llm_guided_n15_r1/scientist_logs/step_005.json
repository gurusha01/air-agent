  "reasoning": "The current best strategy involves starting with move 0 and then copying the opponent's last move. This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our moves. However, introducing randomness or disruptions has not improved the score significantly. We need a strategy that maintains our preference for move 0 while occasionally disrupting the opponent's copying pattern to maximize our payoff.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with move 0, then use a probabilistic approach: with a 70% chance, copy the opponent's last move; with a 30% chance, switch to move 0 \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's copying behavior while ensuring we frequently choose our preferred strategy.\n2. Start with move 0, then alternate between copying the opponent's last move and choosing move 0 every other round \u2014 This could introduce a predictable pattern that still favors our preferred strategy.\n3. Start with move 0, then choose move 0 if the opponent copied us in the last move; otherwise, copy the opponent's last move \u2014 This leverages the opponent's copying tendency while ensuring we stick to our preferred strategy when possible.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it introduces a probabilistic element that could exploit the opponent's copying behavior while maintaining a focus on our preferred strategy.",
