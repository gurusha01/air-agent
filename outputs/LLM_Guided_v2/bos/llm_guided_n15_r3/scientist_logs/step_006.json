Monitor the opponent's moves, and if they copy our move more than 80% of the time, introduce a probabilistic switch: with a 70% chance, continue with 0, and with a 30% chance, switch to 1. This should help exploit the opponent's tendency to copy while maintaining a balance between our preferred strategy and the opponent's preference.",

  "reasoning": "The current best strategy involves starting with a move of 0 and monitoring the opponent's behavior. If they copy our move more than 80% of the time, we switch to a probabilistic strategy to exploit their tendency. This approach has shown consistent improvement in scores. The key insight is that the opponent's tendency to copy can be exploited by establishing a pattern and then strategically switching moves.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Implement a strategy that starts with 0, and after a few rounds, switches to a probabilistic approach based on the opponent's copying behavior \u2014 this could further exploit the opponent's tendency.\n2. Develop a strategy that alternates between 0 and 1 based on a fixed pattern, then adapts based on the opponent's response \u2014 this might confuse the opponent and lead to higher payoffs.\n3. Use a strategy that starts with 0, and if the opponent copies twice in a row, switch to 1 for a single round before returning to 0 \u2014 this might disrupt the opponent's copying pattern.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the current best strategy by adding a probabilistic element, which could further improve the score by exploiting the opponent's behavior more effectively.",
