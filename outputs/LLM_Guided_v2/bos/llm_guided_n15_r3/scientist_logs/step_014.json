  "reasoning": "The current strategy that monitors the opponent's moves and adjusts based on their tendency to copy has shown significant improvement over the baseline. The best-performing node involves starting with strategy 0 and adapting based on the opponent's behavior. However, further refinement could be achieved by introducing a probabilistic switch to better exploit the opponent's copying behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic switch to choose strategy 0 or 1 based on the opponent's copying behavior \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's tendency to copy, potentially increasing our score.\n2. Implement a strategy that alternates between 0 and 1 based on the opponent's last two moves \u2014 This might confuse the opponent and yield a better payoff.\n3. Use a fixed pattern of moves (e.g., 0, 0, 1) to see if it can exploit the opponent's copying behavior \u2014 This could create a predictable pattern that the opponent might follow, leading to higher payoffs.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the current best-performing strategy and introduces a probabilistic element that could further enhance performance.",
