This should help exploit the opponent's copying behavior while maintaining a preference for our optimal strategy.",

  "reasoning": "The current best strategy involves monitoring the opponent's moves and adjusting based on their tendency to copy our moves. This approach has yielded the highest score so far. The executor has been successful in implementing strategies that involve probabilistic decision-making based on the opponent's behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic switch to choose 1 if the opponent copies our move more than 80% of the time \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy, potentially increasing our score.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds if the opponent copies our move more than 80% of the time \u2014 This could confuse the opponent and break their copying pattern.\n3. Stick with the current best strategy but introduce a small random chance to switch to 1 \u2014 This could introduce unpredictability and potentially increase our score by exploiting the opponent's copying behavior.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly targets the opponent's tendency to copy, which is a significant aspect of their strategy, and it aligns with the executor's capabilities.",
