  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting with 0 and then copying the opponent's last move (tit-for-tat) yielded a score of 1.0724, which is an improvement over the baseline. This suggests that leveraging the opponent's tendency to copy our last move is beneficial. However, there might be room for improvement by incorporating more strategic variations that exploit the opponent's behavior further.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This might confuse the opponent and exploit their tendency to copy, potentially leading to higher payoffs.\n2. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies twice in a row \u2014 This strategy could capitalize on the opponent's copying behavior by switching to their preferred move after establishing a pattern.\n3. Use a probabilistic approach: choose 0 with 70% probability and 1 with 30% \u2014 This introduces randomness, which might disrupt the opponent's copying strategy and yield better results.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it directly leverages the opponent's copying tendency and aligns with our preference for strategy 0 while adapting to the opponent's behavior.",
