Monitor the opponent's moves, and if they copy our move more than 80% of the time, introduce a probabilistic switch to occasionally choose 1. This can be done by using a random choice with a small probability (e.g., 10%) to switch to 1, even if the opponent is copying our moves.",
  "executor_guidance": "Use the `random` package to implement the probabilistic switch. Ensure that the probability of switching to 1 is low enough to maintain the advantage of the opponent's copying behavior. Avoid making the strategy too complex, as it should remain under 100 lines of code.",

  "reasoning": "The current best-performing strategy involves starting with a move of 0 and monitoring the opponent's behavior to adapt our strategy. The opponent's tendency to copy our last move can be exploited by adjusting our strategy based on their copying behavior. This approach has shown consistent improvement in scores.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic switch based on the opponent's copying behavior \u2014 This could further exploit the opponent's tendency to copy, potentially increasing our score.\n2. Implement a mixed strategy that occasionally randomizes our move to prevent the opponent from fully predicting our actions \u2014 This might introduce unpredictability, making it harder for the opponent to exploit our strategy.\n3. Refine the current best strategy by adding a condition to switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move more than 90% of the time \u2014 This could capitalize on the opponent's predictable behavior.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the current best strategy and introduces a probabilistic element that could further exploit the opponent's copying tendency.",
