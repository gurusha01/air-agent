  "reasoning": "The initial strategy of starting with 0 and then copying the opponent's last move (tit-for-tat) yielded a score of 1.0724, which is better than the baseline. However, the attempt to switch to strategy 1 after the opponent copied twice in a row resulted in a lower score of 0.7468. This suggests that the opponent's behavior is not being exploited effectively by this switch strategy.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent copies our move more than 80% of the time in the first few rounds \u2014 This might exploit the opponent's tendency to copy, potentially leading to a higher score.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This could confuse the opponent and might lead to a better average payoff if the opponent's copying behavior is disrupted.\n3. Use a probabilistic approach: start with 0, then choose 0 with 70% probability and 1 with 30% probability based on the opponent's last move \u2014 This might introduce enough randomness to exploit the opponent's copying tendency.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly targets the opponent's copying tendency, which is a known behavior, and attempts to exploit it by switching strategies based on observed behavior.",
