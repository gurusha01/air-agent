  "reasoning": "The current best strategy involves monitoring the opponent's moves and adapting our strategy based on their tendency to copy our moves. This approach has yielded the highest score so far. The idea of introducing a probabilistic switch based on the opponent's copying behavior has shown promise.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic switch to choose 1 if the opponent copies our move more than 80% of the time \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's copying tendency further and improve our score.\n2. Implement a strategy that alternates between 0 and 1 based on the opponent's last two moves \u2014 This might confuse the opponent and lead to better outcomes.\n3. Use a fixed pattern of moves that maximizes our payoff given the opponent's copying behavior \u2014 This could stabilize our score by exploiting predictable patterns.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the current best strategy and has the potential to exploit the opponent's copying behavior more effectively.",
