  "reasoning": "The previous best-performing strategy (Node root_0_1) involved starting with a move of 0 and then monitoring the opponent's behavior to adapt accordingly. This approach leveraged the opponent's tendency to copy our moves. However, we can further refine this strategy by incorporating a probabilistic element to switch between strategies based on the opponent's behavior, which might yield a better score.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Implement a strategy that starts with 0, and if the opponent copies our move more than 80% of the time, switch to 1 for a round, then return to 0. This could exploit the opponent's copying tendency while still maximizing our preferred payoff.\n2. Use a strategy that alternates between 0 and 1 every two rounds, regardless of the opponent's moves. This might confuse the opponent's copying strategy and lead to more favorable outcomes.\n3. Implement a strategy that starts with 0 and switches to 1 if the opponent has copied our last move for the past three rounds. This could exploit the opponent's pattern and maximize our payoff by anticipating their moves.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our moves and introduces a simple switch mechanism that could lead to a higher payoff.",
