We need to start with a basic strategy that leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move with 80% probability. A simple and effective approach could be to start with our preferred strategy and then adapt based on the opponent's responses.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Always play 0 \u2014 This strategy is straightforward and exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our move, maximizing our preferred payoff.\n2. Tit-for-tat \u2014 Start with 0 and then copy the opponent's last move. This can help in maintaining cooperation.\n3. Mixed strategy \u2014 Randomly choose between 0 and 1 with a higher probability for 0, to balance between exploiting the opponent's copying tendency and adapting to their strategy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it is simple and directly exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our move, which aligns with our preference for strategy 0.",
