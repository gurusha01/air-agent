However, introducing a reactive component could potentially improve the score by better responding to the opponent's behavior. The nodes that attempted to introduce reactive components have shown some promise, but they haven't surpassed the best static strategy yet.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Introduce a probabilistic element where we return 0 with a high probability and 1 occasionally to test the opponent's response \u2014 This might work by occasionally disrupting the opponent's copying pattern and potentially gaining a higher payoff.\n2. Implement a strategy that switches to 1 if the opponent plays 1 twice in a row, then returns to 0 \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy and adapt to their behavior.\n3. Use a strategy that starts with 0, and if the opponent plays 1, switch to 1 for one round before returning to 0 \u2014 This might work by testing the opponent's response to our change and potentially gaining a better payoff.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it introduces a probabilistic element that could disrupt the opponent's copying pattern while maintaining a preference for strategy 0.",
