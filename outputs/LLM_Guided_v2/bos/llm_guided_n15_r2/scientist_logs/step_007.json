  "reasoning": "The current best strategy involves starting with a move of 0 and incorporating a reactive component to switch strategies based on the opponent's behavior. This approach leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move with an 80% probability. The strategy that consistently returns 0 has shown good results, but adding a reactive element could potentially improve the score further by better adapting to the opponent's behavior.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with 0, then switch to 1 if the opponent plays 1 twice in a row, but switch back to 0 if they play 0 again \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's tendency to copy and adapt to their strategy.\n2. Use a probabilistic approach where we play 0 with a high probability but occasionally play 1 to test the opponent's response \u2014 This might introduce an element of unpredictability that could be beneficial.\n3. Start with 0, and if the opponent plays 1, switch to 1 for a single round before reverting to 0 \u2014 This could exploit the opponent's copying behavior while minimizing the risk of low payoffs.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing strategy by adding a simple reactive element that could improve adaptability to the opponent's behavior.",
