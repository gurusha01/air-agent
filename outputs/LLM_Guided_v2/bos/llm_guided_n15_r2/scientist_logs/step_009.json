  "reasoning": "The strategies that have shown promise so far involve exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy our last move. The best performing strategy so far is a static strategy of always returning 0, which leverages the opponent's 80% tendency to copy. However, introducing a reactive component that adapts based on the opponent's behavior could potentially improve the score further. The current best score is 1.4403, achieved by always returning 0.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Always return 0 \u2014 This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy our move, which has already shown the best results.\n2. Start with 0, then use a tit-for-tat approach with a bias towards 0 \u2014 This could potentially improve the score by adapting to the opponent's behavior while still exploiting their tendency to copy.\n3. Start with 0, and if the opponent plays 1 twice in a row, switch to playing 1 for the next round \u2014 This introduces a simple reactive component that could disrupt the opponent's copying pattern.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because it introduces a reactive element while maintaining a bias towards 0, which has shown to be effective.",
