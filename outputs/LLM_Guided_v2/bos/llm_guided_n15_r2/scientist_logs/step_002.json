  "reasoning": "The previous strategies that were implemented showed a significant improvement over the baseline by exploiting the opponent's tendency to copy our last move. The strategy that always returns 0 performed slightly better than a tit-for-tat approach biased towards 0. This suggests that a simpler strategy that takes advantage of the opponent's predictable behavior can be effective. However, there may still be room for improvement by introducing a more dynamic element that can adapt based on the opponent's responses.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Always return 0 \u2014 This exploits the opponent's tendency to copy, but lacks adaptability.\n2. Tit-for-tat biased towards 0 \u2014 This adapts to the opponent but may not fully exploit their copying tendency.\n3. Adaptive strategy: Start with 0, switch to 1 if the opponent doesn't copy, then return to 0 \u2014 This could balance exploitation and adaptability by reacting to the opponent's failure to copy.\n\nCHOSEN: 3 because it combines the strengths of both exploitation and adaptability, potentially leading to a higher score by adjusting based on the opponent's behavior.",
