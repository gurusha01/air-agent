  "reasoning": "We are starting from scratch, so we need to devise a strategy that takes advantage of the opponent's tendency to copy our last move with 80% probability. The baseline score is 1.0227, and we aim to improve upon this by crafting a strategy that maximizes our payoff.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with strategy 0 and switch to 1 if the opponent chooses 1 twice consecutively \u2014 This leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our move and aims to maximize our payoff by aligning with their preference when they show a pattern.\n2. Use a tit-for-tat strategy, starting with 0 \u2014 Begin with our preferred strategy and then mimic the opponent's last move, which could exploit their tendency to copy us.\n3. Alternate between 0 and 1 every two rounds \u2014 This approach might confuse the opponent's copying strategy and allow us to gain higher payoffs by occasionally aligning with their preference.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it directly exploits the opponent's copying tendency and adjusts based on their behavior, potentially maximizing our payoff.",
