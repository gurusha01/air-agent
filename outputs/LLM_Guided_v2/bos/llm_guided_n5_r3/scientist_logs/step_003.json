  "reasoning": "The previous strategies have shown that starting with strategy 0 and then adapting based on the opponent's behavior can yield better results. The opponent's tendency to copy our last move with 80% probability can be exploited by creating a predictable pattern that maximizes our payoff. The best-performing strategy so far started with 0 and switched to 1 if the opponent chose 1 twice in a row.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Start with strategy 0 for the first two rounds, then switch to 1 if the opponent chose 1 in the last round, otherwise continue with 0 \u2014 This leverages the opponent's tendency to copy our last move and creates a predictable pattern.\n2. Alternate between 0 and 1 every round \u2014 This strategy might confuse the opponent and exploit their tendency to copy our last move.\n3. Start with strategy 0 and switch to 1 if the opponent chose 1 in the last two rounds \u2014 This is a variation of the best-performing strategy with a slight tweak to see if it improves the score.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it creates a predictable pattern that can exploit the opponent's tendency to copy our last move, and it builds on the best-performing strategy so far.",
