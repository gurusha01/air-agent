Previous attempts with CatBoost and LightGBM did not outperform the ExtraTreesClassifier. The RandomForestClassifier with increased depth did not yield better results, suggesting that simpler models might be more effective for this dataset.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Try ExtraTreesClassifier with increased n_estimators=200 and max_depth=7 \u2014 This might capture more patterns and improve accuracy slightly without overfitting.\n2. Use GradientBoostingClassifier with n_estimators=100 and learning_rate=0.1 \u2014 A different boosting approach might capture different patterns and improve accuracy.\n3. Use AdaBoostClassifier with base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5) and n_estimators=100 \u2014 This ensemble method might provide a different perspective and improve accuracy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it builds on the best-performing model with a slight variation that the executor can implement easily.",
