  "reasoning": "The RandomForestClassifier with n_estimators=100 and max_depth=5 achieved the highest score so far (0.9402). This suggests that tree-based models with moderate complexity are effective on this dataset. However, attempts to improve CatBoost and LightGBM did not yield better results, possibly due to suboptimal hyperparameter settings or preprocessing steps. Given the success of RandomForest, we should explore further tuning of its hyperparameters or try another tree-based model like ExtraTreesClassifier which might capture different patterns.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Tune RandomForestClassifier with n_estimators=150 and max_depth=7 \u2014 This might capture more complex patterns and improve accuracy slightly.\n2. Use ExtraTreesClassifier with n_estimators=100 and max_depth=5 \u2014 It is similar to RandomForest but can sometimes perform better due to its different sampling strategy.\n3. Retry LightGBM with n_estimators=200 and learning_rate=0.05 \u2014 Adjusting these hyperparameters might improve its performance given its gradient boosting nature.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because ExtraTreesClassifier is similar to RandomForest and might capture different patterns, potentially improving accuracy with minimal risk.",
