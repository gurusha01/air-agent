  "reasoning": "The ExtraTreesClassifier with modest complexity has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 0.9833. This suggests that this model captures patterns effectively in the Titanic dataset. Other models like RandomForest and CatBoost have not performed as well, and LightGBM has not been fully explored. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on refining the best-performing model is a prudent strategy.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase the number of estimators in ExtraTreesClassifier to 500 \u2014 This might improve the model's performance by capturing more patterns, but there's a risk of overfitting.\n2. Use ExtraTreesClassifier with max_depth=7 and n_estimators=100 \u2014 This could balance complexity and performance, potentially improving accuracy without overfitting.\n3. Try LightGBM with different hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators=300, learning_rate=0.03) \u2014 LightGBM's gradient boosting might offer improvements, but it's a riskier choice given its previous performance.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because increasing the number of estimators in the best-performing model could capture more patterns and potentially improve accuracy further.",
