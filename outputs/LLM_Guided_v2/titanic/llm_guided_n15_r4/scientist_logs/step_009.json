  "reasoning": "The ExtraTreesClassifier with modest complexity has shown the best performance so far with a score of 0.9833. This suggests that tree-based models with moderate complexity are effective for this dataset. Attempts to increase complexity in CatBoost and RandomForest did not yield better results. LightGBM did not perform well in the previous attempt, possibly due to suboptimal hyperparameters. Given the remaining nodes, we should focus on refining the best-performing approach and exploring a new model family that the executor can handle.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Increase the complexity of ExtraTreesClassifier further by adjusting n_estimators and max_depth \u2014 it might capture more patterns and improve accuracy.\n2. Try a simple implementation of GradientBoostingClassifier with n_estimators=100 and learning_rate=0.1 \u2014 it might offer a balance between complexity and performance.\n3. Refine the LightGBM approach with different hyperparameters such as n_estimators=200 and learning_rate=0.05 \u2014 it might perform better with these adjustments.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because ExtraTreesClassifier has already shown the best performance, and further tuning might yield even better results.",
