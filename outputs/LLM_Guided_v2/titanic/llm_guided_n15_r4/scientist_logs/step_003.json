  "reasoning": "The RandomForestClassifier with basic preprocessing achieved the highest score so far (0.9402), indicating that simple ensemble methods with basic preprocessing are effective on this dataset. The XGBoost model did not perform as well, suggesting that more complex models might not be necessary. We still have room to explore other model families that the executor can handle, such as LightGBM or CatBoost, which might offer improvements over RandomForest.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with n_estimators=100 and learning_rate=0.1 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and might outperform RandomForest with the right settings.\n2. Use CatBoost with iterations=100 and learning_rate=0.1 \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features well and might improve performance.\n3. Refine RandomForestClassifier with n_estimators=200 and max_depth=7 \u2014 Further tuning RandomForest might yield better results.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly could lead to better performance without complex preprocessing.",
