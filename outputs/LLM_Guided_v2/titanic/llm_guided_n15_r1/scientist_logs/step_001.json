  "reasoning": "The XGBoost model with default settings and simple preprocessing (filling numeric NaN values with the median) has already improved the baseline score. This indicates that tree-based models with basic preprocessing can be effective. However, we should explore other models to see if we can achieve better accuracy. CatBoost is another tree-based model that handles categorical features well and might further improve the score. Additionally, LightGBM is known for its speed and efficiency, which could be beneficial.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6. Preprocess by filling numeric NaN with median and pass categorical features directly to CatBoost using the cat_features parameter. \u2014 This might work because CatBoost is effective with categorical data and can handle missing values.\n2. Use LightGBM with default settings. Preprocess by filling numeric NaN with median and use LabelEncoder for categorical features. \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and might offer a performance boost with minimal preprocessing.\n3. Use RandomForestClassifier from sklearn with n_estimators=100 and max_depth=7. Preprocess by filling numeric NaN with median and use LabelEncoder for categorical features. \u2014 Random forests are robust and might provide a competitive accuracy.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly and its robustness with missing values might lead to a better accuracy improvement over the current best.",
