  "memory_update": "XGBoost can handle missing values internally, making it a good initial choice for simple preprocessing.",
  "reasoning": "We are starting from scratch, so we need to establish a baseline with a simple model and preprocessing steps. The executor can handle models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost well, and these models are known for their performance on tabular data. We should start with a straightforward approach using one of these models and simple preprocessing to see if we can surpass the baseline score of 0.7655.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use XGBoost with default settings \u2014 XGBoost is robust and often performs well with minimal tuning. It can handle missing values internally, which simplifies preprocessing.\n2. Use LightGBM with default settings \u2014 LightGBM is similar to XGBoost but can be faster and more efficient, especially with large datasets.\n3. Use CatBoost with default settings \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features natively, which can be advantageous given the Titanic dataset's categorical nature.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because XGBoost is a reliable starting point and can handle missing data without extensive preprocessing, which is suitable for the executor's capabilities.",
