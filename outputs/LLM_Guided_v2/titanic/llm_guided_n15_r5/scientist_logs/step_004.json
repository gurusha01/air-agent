  "reasoning": "The best performing model so far is Logistic Regression with a score of 0.9450. The LightGBM attempt failed due to an incorrect argument in the train function. The RandomForestClassifier and XGBoostClassifier showed moderate improvements over the baseline. We should explore another model family that handles categorical data well, such as CatBoost, which is known for its ability to handle categorical features without extensive preprocessing.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoostClassifier with default settings \u2014 CatBoost is efficient with categorical data and might outperform existing models.\n2. Refine the Logistic Regression model by adding polynomial features \u2014 Could improve the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships.\n3. Try a GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn \u2014 Another boosting method that might offer improvements over RandomForest and XGBoost.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost can handle categorical features directly, which might lead to better performance without complex preprocessing.",
