  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters performed well, achieving a score of 0.8900. This suggests that leveraging models that handle categorical data directly can be effective. We have not yet explored other model families like XGBoost or LightGBM, which are also capable of handling categorical data efficiently. Trying these models could provide additional insights or improvements. Given that we have 4 nodes remaining, we can afford to explore a new model family while also considering a refinement of the CatBoost approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use XGBoost with hyperparameters: n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.03, max_depth=6 \u2014 XGBoost is known for its performance and might provide a competitive score. It requires explicit handling of categorical data, which could be a risk if not done correctly.\n2. Use LightGBM with hyperparameters: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles large datasets well. It also requires explicit handling of categorical features, but it can be very effective if done right.\n3. Refine CatBoost with different hyperparameters: iterations=700, learning_rate=0.02, depth=7 \u2014 Since CatBoost performed well, a slight tweak in hyperparameters might yield even better results.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because exploring XGBoost provides diversity in our approach and could potentially match or exceed the CatBoost performance.",
