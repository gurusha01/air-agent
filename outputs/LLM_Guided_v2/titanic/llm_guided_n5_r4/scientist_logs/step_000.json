Drop columns with more than 50% missing values. Do not use get_dummies for categorical columns; instead, pass the cat_features parameter to CatBoost. If you encounter a dtype error, cast categorical columns to strings first.",

  "memory_update": "CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features directly can simplify preprocessing and potentially improve model performance on datasets with categorical data.",
  "reasoning": "We are starting from the baseline with no model execution. The task is to improve upon the baseline accuracy of 0.7655. Given the executor's strengths, we should focus on simple, well-documented models and preprocessing steps that can be implemented in a straightforward manner. The executor can handle sklearn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost pipelines effectively. We should avoid complex feature engineering and multi-step processes.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use a RandomForestClassifier with default settings \u2014 Random forests are robust and often perform well without extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n2. Use a LightGBM model with basic settings \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and can handle categorical features directly, which might improve performance.\n3. Use a CatBoost model with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6 \u2014 CatBoost is effective with categorical data and requires minimal preprocessing.\n\nCHOSEN: 3 because CatBoost can handle categorical features directly, which simplifies preprocessing and might lead to better performance given the nature of the Titanic dataset.",
