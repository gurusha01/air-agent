  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with specific hyperparameters has shown the best performance so far, achieving a score of 0.8900. The LightGBM attempt failed due to incorrect usage of parameters. XGBoost performed decently but not as well as CatBoost. Since we have only one node left, it's crucial to refine the best-performing model, CatBoost, with slight hyperparameter adjustments to see if we can push the score higher.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with slightly different hyperparameters (e.g., increase depth or iterations) \u2014 This might improve the score as CatBoost is already performing well.\n2. Try a different preprocessing technique with CatBoost (e.g., scaling numeric features) \u2014 This might help if the model is sensitive to feature scaling.\n3. Use a simple ensemble of the best CatBoost models \u2014 This could improve performance but might be too complex for the executor.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because refining the best-performing model with slight hyperparameter adjustments is the most straightforward and likely to yield a small improvement without exceeding the executor's capabilities.",
