  "reasoning": "The LightGBM model with basic preprocessing achieved the highest score so far, indicating that boosting methods are effective for this dataset. The failure in the XGBoost node was due to unseen labels in the target variable, suggesting a need for careful handling of the target variable. CatBoost also performed well, benefiting from its native handling of categorical features. Further tuning of LightGBM might yield even better results.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Tune LightGBM further by adjusting hyperparameters such as `num_leaves` and `min_data_in_leaf` \u2014 LightGBM has shown promise, and fine-tuning could improve performance.\n2. Use CatBoost with different hyperparameters, such as increasing `iterations` and adjusting `learning_rate` \u2014 CatBoost's handling of categorical features is advantageous, and tuning could enhance results.\n3. Try a simple ensemble of the best-performing models (LightGBM and CatBoost) \u2014 Combining the strengths of both models might yield a higher score, but it could be complex for the executor.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because LightGBM has shown the best results so far, and further tuning is likely to improve performance without adding complexity.",
