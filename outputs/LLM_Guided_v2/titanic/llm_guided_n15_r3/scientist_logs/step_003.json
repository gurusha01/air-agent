  "reasoning": "The LightGBM model with simple preprocessing achieved the best score so far, indicating that boosting methods are effective for this task. The failure with XGBoost was due to unseen labels in the target variable, suggesting a need for careful handling of categorical data. The Random Forest model also performed well, showing that tree-based models are promising. We have not yet tried CatBoost, which could leverage categorical features effectively without extensive preprocessing.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6 \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features natively, which might improve performance and simplify preprocessing.\n2. Refine LightGBM with n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=4 \u2014 A slight adjustment to hyperparameters might yield better results given its previous success.\n3. Try a simple Logistic Regression with standard scaling \u2014 This provides a baseline for linear models and might offer insights into feature importance.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost can handle categorical features directly, potentially improving performance and simplifying preprocessing.",
