  "reasoning": "CatBoost has consistently shown strong performance due to its ability to handle categorical features directly. The best score achieved so far is 0.8900 with CatBoost. LightGBM also showed promise with a score of 0.8780, but CatBoost remains superior. Given the limited number of nodes remaining, further refining CatBoost's hyperparameters is the most promising approach. Previous attempts with LightGBM and other models either failed or did not surpass CatBoost's performance.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Further refine CatBoost with slightly adjusted hyperparameters \u2014 CatBoost has been the best performer, and small tweaks might yield a marginal improvement.\n2. Try a different preprocessing strategy with CatBoost \u2014 While CatBoost handles categorical features well, a different approach to numerical features might help.\n3. Attempt a simple ensemble of CatBoost and LightGBM \u2014 While risky due to complexity, it could leverage strengths from both models.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because it has the highest likelihood of a small improvement without introducing complexity that the executor might struggle with.",
