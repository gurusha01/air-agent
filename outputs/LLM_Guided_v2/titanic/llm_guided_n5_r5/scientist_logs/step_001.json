  "reasoning": "The previous node successfully used CatBoostClassifier with default settings and simple preprocessing, achieving a score of 0.8852. This suggests that CatBoost is a strong model for this task. To further improve, we can explore other models that handle categorical features well or refine the CatBoost approach with specific hyperparameter tuning. We should also consider trying a different model family to ensure diversity in our approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with categorical feature support \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles categorical features well, which might yield a good score.\n2. Refine CatBoost with hyperparameter tuning (iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.01, depth=8) \u2014 This could improve the model's performance by allowing it to learn more complex patterns.\n3. Use XGBoost with one-hot encoding for categorical features \u2014 XGBoost is a strong performer in many classification tasks and could provide a competitive score.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because refining CatBoost, which already performed well, might yield the best improvement with minimal risk.",
