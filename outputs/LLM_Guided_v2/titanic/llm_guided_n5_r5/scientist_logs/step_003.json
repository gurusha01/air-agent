The XGBoost model with default settings performed poorly, indicating it may not be as suitable for this dataset without further tuning. Given the limited nodes remaining, focusing on refining the best-performing model (CatBoost) with small tweaks is a prudent strategy.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Refine CatBoost with a slight increase in iterations and a moderate learning rate \u2014 This might improve performance by allowing the model to learn more complex patterns without overfitting.\n2. Try LightGBM with default settings \u2014 LightGBM is another tree-based model that might perform well on this dataset and is within the executor's capabilities.\n3. Use CatBoost with a smaller depth and early stopping \u2014 This could prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost has already shown high performance, and a slight hyperparameter adjustment could yield further improvements without significant risk.",
