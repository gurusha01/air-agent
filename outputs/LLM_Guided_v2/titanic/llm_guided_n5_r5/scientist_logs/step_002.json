  "reasoning": "The CatBoost model with default settings achieved a high score, indicating its effectiveness for this dataset. The attempt to refine it with specific hyperparameters did not improve the score, suggesting that further hyperparameter tuning might not yield significant gains. We have not yet explored other model families, which could provide additional insights or improvements. Given the budget constraints, it's prudent to try a new model family and refine the best approach.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use XGBoost with default settings \u2014 XGBoost is another powerful gradient boosting model that might perform well on this dataset.\n2. Use LightGBM with default settings \u2014 LightGBM is known for its efficiency and might offer a good balance of speed and accuracy.\n3. Refine CatBoost with a different preprocessing strategy \u2014 This could include trying different ways to handle missing values or categorical features.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because XGBoost is a strong alternative to CatBoost and might offer competitive performance with default settings.",
