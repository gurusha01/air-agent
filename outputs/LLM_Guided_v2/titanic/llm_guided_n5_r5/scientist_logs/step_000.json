  "reasoning": "Since this is the first attempt, we have no accumulated knowledge from previous nodes. We need to start with a simple and robust model that the executor can handle well. Given the baseline score of 0.7655, we should aim for a model that is easy to implement and has a good track record on tabular data. CatBoost is a good candidate because it handles categorical features natively and is less sensitive to preprocessing errors.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with default settings \u2014 CatBoost is robust and handles categorical data well without extensive preprocessing.\n2. Use XGBoost with default settings \u2014 XGBoost is powerful for tabular data but requires more careful handling of categorical features.\n3. Use LightGBM with default settings \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and handles large datasets well, but like XGBoost, it requires more preprocessing for categorical data.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost's native handling of categorical features reduces the risk of preprocessing errors and is straightforward for the executor to implement.",
