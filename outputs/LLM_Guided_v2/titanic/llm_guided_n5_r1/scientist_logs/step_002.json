  "reasoning": "The previous attempts with LightGBM and XGBoost failed due to errors related to feature handling and unseen labels. The errors suggest issues with data preprocessing, specifically with categorical features and handling of NaN values. The baseline score is relatively high, so a simple model with proper preprocessing might improve accuracy. CatBoost is known for handling categorical variables efficiently without extensive preprocessing, which could be beneficial.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use CatBoost with default settings, leveraging its ability to handle categorical features natively \u2014 this might work because it simplifies preprocessing and avoids label encoding issues.\n2. Use RandomForestClassifier from sklearn with basic preprocessing (median fill for NaNs, label encoding for categoricals) \u2014 this might work as a robust, simple model with fewer preprocessing requirements.\n3. Use LogisticRegression with standard scaling and one-hot encoding for categorical features \u2014 this might work by providing a simple linear model that can be easily implemented by the executor.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because CatBoost can handle categorical features natively, reducing the risk of preprocessing errors and unseen label issues.",
