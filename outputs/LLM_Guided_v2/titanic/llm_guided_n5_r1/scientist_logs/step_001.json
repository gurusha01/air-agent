  "reasoning": "The failure in the previous attempt was due to a `KeyError: 'PassengerId'`, indicating that the executor might have tried to use a column that was not properly handled or dropped. The executor also used all 15 actions without validating, suggesting the approach was too complex or not well-directed. We need to simplify the task and ensure all necessary columns are correctly processed.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use XGBoost with default settings \u2014 XGBoost is robust and often performs well with minimal tuning. It might handle the data better with simple preprocessing.\n2. Use LightGBM with specific hyperparameters \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and might perform better with specific settings. We can try a slightly different preprocessing approach.\n3. Use CatBoost with categorical features specified \u2014 CatBoost is designed to handle categorical data effectively and might avoid issues with encoding.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because XGBoost is a solid choice that the executor can implement easily, and it might avoid the issues seen with LightGBM.",
