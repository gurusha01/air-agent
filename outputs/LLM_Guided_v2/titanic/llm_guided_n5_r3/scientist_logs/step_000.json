  "reasoning": "We are starting from scratch, so we need to explore a few different models to see which performs best on the Titanic dataset. Given the executor's capabilities, we should focus on simple, well-known models that it can implement effectively. The baseline score is 0.7655, so we need to surpass this with our models. We should start with models that are easy to implement and can handle missing data and categorical variables effectively.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use a RandomForestClassifier with default settings \u2014 Random Forests are robust to overfitting and handle missing data well; they are also straightforward for the executor to implement.\n2. Use a GradientBoostingClassifier with learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100 \u2014 Gradient Boosting can provide strong performance and is within the executor's capabilities.\n3. Use a LogisticRegression with standard scaling for numeric features \u2014 Logistic Regression is simple and can serve as a good baseline model for comparison.\n\nCHOSEN: 1 because Random Forests are easy to implement and handle missing data and categorical variables effectively, which should help us quickly establish a performance benchmark above the baseline.",
