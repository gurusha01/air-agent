The XGBoost attempt failed due to context length issues, likely because the executor tried to handle too much complexity or data at once. Tree-based models with straightforward preprocessing seem effective for this task.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n1. Use LightGBM with specific settings: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=100 \u2014 LightGBM is efficient and might offer a performance boost with simple preprocessing.\n2. Refine RandomForestClassifier by adjusting hyperparameters: n_estimators=200, max_depth=10 \u2014 Building on the success of the RandomForest, tuning hyperparameters might yield better results.\n3. Use CatBoost with specific settings: iterations=500, learning_rate=0.03, depth=6 \u2014 CatBoost handles categorical features well and might improve accuracy with minimal preprocessing.\n\nCHOSEN: 2 because refining the RandomForestClassifier, which already showed good results, is likely to yield further improvements with minimal risk.",
