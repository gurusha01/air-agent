Additionally, introduce robust scaling of numerical features using the median and interquartile range (IQR) to improve stability in the presence of outliers, and apply a logarithmic transformation only to the features that exhibit high skewness (identified via boxplot analysis), not the target. This strategy leverages LightGBM's efficiency and robustness to sparse data while improving feature relevance through iterative selection.",

The best-performing approach so far is the **random forest ensemble with 1000 trees, max depth 8, and feature bagging via bootstrap sampling**, achieving an R\u00b2 of **0.8815**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (0.8800). This success likely stems from the robustness of random forests to noise, effective handling of non-linear relationships, and the stability provided by bagging, which reduces variance without overfitting.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **deep neural networks (especially with complex architectures or transformers)**, such as TabTransformers or multi-layer networks with batch normalization, have consistently failed (e.g., scores dropped to 0.7924 or below, with repeated LLM errors), suggesting that the dataset lacks sufficient non-linearity or signal for deep models to exploit. Similarly, **target-dependent binning or polynomial expansion** in random forests or gradient boosting has shown poor performance, likely due to poor feature distribution or overfitting.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the random forest ensemble from root_3_0_0_1 (0.7924)** by introducing **log-transformed features (log(living_area), log(bathroom_count))** and **target encoding for categorical variables like 'neighborhood' and 'house_type'**, while maintaining the same 1000-tree, depth-8 configuration. This combines proven feature engineering (log-transformations) with categorical handling (target encoding), both of which have shown promise in related experiments, and should..."
