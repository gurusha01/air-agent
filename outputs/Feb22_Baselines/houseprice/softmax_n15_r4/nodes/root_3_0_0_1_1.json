Use early stopping during training to prevent overfitting and validate on a time-based split to ensure temporal coherence. This approach introduces a parametric, non-tree-based model with structured feature augmentation to capture complex interactions that tree-based models may miss.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the random forest ensemble with 1000 trees, max depth 8, and feature bagging (bootstrap sampling), achieving an R\u00b2 of **0.8815**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (0.8800). This suggests that ensemble methods with controlled depth and robust feature sampling are effective in capturing non-linear patterns without overfitting, especially in house price data with complex, noisy interactions.  \n\n2. Deep neural networks (especially with multiple layers and batch normalization) and gradient boosting with aggressive hyperparameters (e.g., XGBoost with depth 6, learning rate 0.05, subsampling 0.8) have consistently failed, with scores dropping to **0.7924** or lower. These failures likely stem from overfitting, poor convergence, or instability in training on noisy, skewed target variables. Target encoding and synthetic features (e.g., polynomial expansion) also failed, possibly due to data leakage or overfitting on small categorical splits.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_3_0_0_1** by introducing a **Random Forest ensemble with 1000 trees, max depth 8, and feature bagging**, but with **target-dependent binning of the price variable** to create stratified splits\u2014specifically, divide prices into quartiles and train the model on each bin separately to improve calibration and reduce skew. This directly addresses the weakness in the earlier failed attempt (root_3_0_0_1_0) and builds on the success of stratified splits in the ..."
