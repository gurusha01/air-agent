Additionally, derive interaction terms such as \"log(living_area) * log(bathrooms)\" and \"log(year_built) * log(living_area)\" to capture non-linear relationships. Normalize all features using min-max scaling before training a gradient boosting model with a maximum depth of 6 and 500 trees, using early stopping on validation R\u00b2. This approach improves model interpretability and reduces the impact of extreme outliers in skewed distributions.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the **random forest ensemble with 1000 trees, maximum depth of 8, and feature bagging via bootstrap sampling**, achieving a strong **R\u00b2 of 0.8815**\u2014outperforming the baseline (0.8800) and outpacing other models like XGBoost or neural networks. This success likely stems from the robustness of random forests to noise, effective handling of non-linear relationships, and the stability provided by bagging, especially with a stratified split that maintains class balance in price distribution.\n\n2. Approaches involving **deep neural networks (especially with multiple layers or batch normalization)** and **polynomial feature expansion** have consistently failed, with scores dropping to as low as **0.7620 or 0.7924**, indicating poor generalization or overfitting. Similarly, **target encoding** and **synthetic features via polynomial expansion** in random forests have failed, suggesting these techniques may introduce noise or instability in the target distribution.\n\n3. The next experiment should **expand root_3_0 by introducing a random forest with 1000 trees, depth 8, and feature bagging, but now apply target-dependent binning of the price variable to create stratified splits during training**\u2014a refinement of the successful strategy. This maintains the strong baseline performance while systematically improving feature distribution alignment with price, potentially pushing R\u00b2 beyond 0.8815 by reducing variance in training dynamics. This is a lo..."
