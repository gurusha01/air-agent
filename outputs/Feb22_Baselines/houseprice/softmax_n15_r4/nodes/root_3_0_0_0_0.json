  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is the random forest ensemble with 1000 trees, max depth 8, and feature bagging via bootstrap sampling, achieving an R\u00b2 of **0.8815**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (0.8800). This success likely stems from the robustness of random forests to noise, effective feature bagging, and the avoidance of overfitting through controlled depth. In contrast, deep neural networks (e.g., root_3_0_0 and root_1) consistently fail, with scores dropping to **0.7620** or lower, indicating poor generalization despite complex architectures and normalization\u2014suggesting that the data lacks sufficient non-linearity or signal for deep models. Spatial feature engineering (root_2) and target-dependent binning (root_3_0_0_0) also underperformed, likely due to poor feature relevance or overfitting in stratified splits. The next experiment should specifically expand root_3_0_0_0 by replacing the random forest with a **gradient boosting model (e.g., LightGBM)**, using **early stopping with a validation set**, **max depth of 6**, and **learning rate of 0.05**, while preserving the target binning strategy to improve model stability and generalization. This combines the robustness of target stratification with the strong predictive power of gradient boosting, offering a high-impact, data-driven path to improve from 0.7620 to above 0.8700."
