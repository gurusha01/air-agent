  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the random forest ensemble with 1000 trees, max depth 8, and feature bagging via bootstrap sampling, achieving an R\u00b2 of **0.8815**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (0.8800). This success likely stems from the robustness of random forests to noise, the stability of bagging, and the effective handling of non-linear relationships without overfitting, especially with a stratified split that ensures balanced training.  \n\n2. Deep neural networks (e.g., in root_3_0_0 and root_1) have consistently failed, with scores dropping to **0.7924** or lower, suggesting that the dataset lacks sufficient complexity or signal for deep architectures, and that overparameterization or poor feature engineering leads to poor generalization. Similarly, gradient boosting with XGBoost (root_3_0_0_1) underperforms at 0.7924, likely due to inappropriate hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth 6, learning rate 0.05, subsampling 0.8) that may not align with the data\u2019s structure.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand root_3_0_0_1 by replacing the XGBoost model with a **Random Forest Regressor** (1000 trees, max depth 8, bootstrap sampling) and applying **target-dependent binning** of the price variable to create stratified feature splits\u2014mirroring the successful strategy in root_3_0, which achieved 0.8815. This should directly test whether structured target binning improves feature distribution and model calibration, especially in price-sensitive regions."
