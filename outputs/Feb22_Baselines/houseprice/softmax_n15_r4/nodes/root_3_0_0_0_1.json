  "reflection": "1. The best-performing strategy so far is the random forest ensemble with 1000 trees, maximum depth of 8, and feature bagging via bootstrap sampling, achieving an R\u00b2 of **0.8815**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (0.8800). This success likely stems from the robustness of random forests to noise, their ability to capture non-linear relationships without overfitting, and the benefit of feature bagging, which improves generalization.  \n\n2. Approaches involving deep neural networks (e.g., 3+ hidden layers, batch normalization, or polynomial features) have consistently failed, with scores dropping to as low as **0.7924** or failing entirely (e.g., error 400), suggesting that the dataset lacks sufficient complexity or signal for deep models to generalize well. Similarly, target-dependent binning or synthetic features via polynomial expansion have failed, likely due to poor feature stability or overfitting in small or noisy splits.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_3_0_0_0** (score: 0.7620) by replacing the Random Forest with a **gradient boosting model (XGBoost)** using **learning rate of 0.05, max depth of 6, subsampling ratio of 0.8, and early stopping** on a validation set with 1000 rounds. This leverages the proven strength of gradient boosting in regression tasks while avoiding overfitting through regularization and early stopping\u2014specifically targeting the underperformance of the current RF setup in capturing complex patterns without overfitting."
