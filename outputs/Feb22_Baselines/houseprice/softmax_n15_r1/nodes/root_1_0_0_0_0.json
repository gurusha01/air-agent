  "strategy": "Introduce a time-series decomposition approach using seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) applied to housing price data by region and year, followed by modeling the decomposed components (trend, seasonality, residuals) with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost). This strategy isolates and models underlying temporal patterns\u2014such as seasonal price spikes during housing sale months or long-term regional growth trends\u2014while preserving domain-relevant dynamics like seasonal demand fluctuations. By explicitly modeling time-based structures, the model reduces noise and captures latent temporal dependencies that traditional PINNs or neural networks may miss. This approach is fundamentally different from physics-informed constraints, as it focuses on time-series structure rather than differential equations.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is **XGBoost with target encoding on categorical variables**, achieving a strong **R\u00b2 of 0.8984**\u2014significantly outperforming baseline (0.8800). This success stems from XGBoost\u2019s ability to capture non-linear interactions and tree-based feature engineering, combined with target encoding that effectively reduces noise in categorical variables like `neighborhood` or `condition`.  \n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed include **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** and **Transformer-based models with attention mechanisms**, both of which resulted in poor performance (e.g., **0.7921** and **0.8432**, respectively). These models are computationally expensive, overfit on small datasets, and fail to capture the structured, interpretable patterns in housing data. Additionally, **deep neural networks without proper regularization or data scaling** (e.g., root_2_0_0 and root_2_1_0) failed due to instability and overfitting.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_0_0** by introducing **XGBoost with target-encoded categorical features and a strong feature selection step using permutation importance**, focusing only on top 10 features (e.g., `gr_liv_area`, `overall_qual`, `year_built`, `garage_area`). This combines the proven strength of gradient boosting with more efficient, interpretable feature engineering\u2014avoiding the complexity of deep learning or physics-based models\u2014while aiming to improve R\u00b2 from 0.7921 to at least 0...."
