Apply target encoding for categorical variables with smoothing to reduce overfitting, and use feature selection via permutation importance to reduce dimensionality. Train with cross-validated R\u00b2 optimization, and tune hyperparameters (learning rate, depth, number of estimators) via Bayesian optimization. This approach leverages tree-based non-linearity and interaction detection without requiring explicit feature engineering, offering better performance than MLP on structured tabular data.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **root_2_0** with an R\u00b2 of **0.8984**, achieved by replacing Ridge regression with a **Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost/LightGBM)** and applying **target encoding on categorical variables** instead of PCA. This strategy works because gradient boosting excels at capturing complex, non-linear interactions in housing data, and target encoding effectively captures category-specific trends (e.g., neighborhood price patterns) that linear models miss. In contrast, **deep learning approaches like root_1_0_0 (Transformer-based)** and **PINNs (root_1_0_0_0)** have failed or underperformed\u2014root_1_0_0 scored only **0.8432**, and root_1_0_0_0 dropped to **0.7921**, likely due to overfitting and poor generalization on sparse, tabular data with limited non-linear structure. The **neural network with deep architecture (root_1)** scored **0.8731**, which is lower than the best, suggesting that deep models without strong regularization or feature engineering struggle with this dataset. The **random forest with permutation importance (root_1_0_1)** failed with a negative score (**-0.0151**), indicating instability or overfitting. Therefore, the next experiment should expand **root_2_1** (R\u00b2: 0.8812) by **adding target encoding to categorical features** and **tuning the XGBoost hyperparameters** (e.g., learning rate = 0.05, max_depth = 6, subsample = 0.8) to improve feature learning and reduce overfitting, leveraging the proven success of target encoding ..."
