  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **root_2** with a score of **0.9033**, achieved through targeted feature engineering\u2014specifically, creating interaction terms (e.g., `total_area \u00d7 floor_area`) and applying polynomial expansions up to degree 2\u2014followed by robust scaling. This success highlights that **non-linear feature relationships** and **domain-aware engineering** significantly improve model performance on house price data, where spatial and structural interactions are likely key drivers. In contrast, approaches involving deep neural networks (DNNs) or complex architectures like STCNs or GNNs have consistently failed, with scores dropping to **-3.2060 or lower**, indicating poor generalization and overfitting on tabular, non-spatial data. Random forests with permutation importance or target encoding have shown mixed results, with **root_2_1_1** scoring only **0.8611**, suggesting that feature selection alone is insufficient without strong feature engineering. The next experiment should expand **root_2_1_0_0** (score: -1.7558), which uses a random forest with target encoding and bagging, by **adding interaction terms between engineered features (e.g., total_area \u00d7 floor_area) and applying polynomial features of degree 2**, then retrain with **robust scaling and hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization** to improve stability and predictive power. This combines the proven strength of feature engineering with a more robust ensemble method, addressing the failure o..."
