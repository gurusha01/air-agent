  "reflection": "The targeted feature engineering in **root_2** achieved the best score of **0.9033**, significantly outperforming the baseline (0.8800), demonstrating that interaction terms (e.g., total_area \u00d7 floor_area) and polynomial expansions up to degree 2 capture non-linear relationships and complex spatial dependencies in housing prices. This success likely stems from the fact that house price is inherently influenced by multiplicative effects\u2014such as area per floor level or floor-to-area ratios\u2014where simple additive features fall short. In contrast, **root_0** and **root_1** failed: root_0 (gradient boosting with target encoding) and root_1 (deep neural networks) did not improve beyond baseline, suggesting that over-reliance on black-box models without strong feature engineering or poor handling of categorical data (e.g., target encoding instability) leads to suboptimal performance. Target encoding may introduce leakage or overfitting in sparse categorical features, while deep neural networks on tabular data without sufficient regularization or feature quality struggle to generalize. The next experiment should expand **root_2** by introducing **polynomial features of degree 3** (e.g., (total_area \u00d7 floor_area)\u00b2) and applying **robust scaling (e.g., RobustScaler)** to stabilize gradients and reduce sensitivity to outliers in skewed area variables. This builds on the proven success of polynomial interactions while addressing potential instability in high-degree features through scalin..."
