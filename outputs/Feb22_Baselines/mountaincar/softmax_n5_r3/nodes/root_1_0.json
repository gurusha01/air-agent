This approach works because it captures the underlying physics more accurately than raw position and velocity, enabling the agent to anticipate future states and plan longer-term actions. In contrast, **root_2** (hierarchical RL) failed entirely, likely due to poor phase transition design and lack of sufficient reward shaping for low-level actions, suggesting that hierarchical policies without strong reward signals or clear phase boundaries are not viable in this simple, high-dimensional continuous control setting. The discrete action space with Gaussian policy in PPO (root_0) failed catastrophically, indicating that action discretization without proper smoothing or continuous action modeling leads to poor exploration and instability. The next experiment should expand **root_1** by introducing a **time-aware attention mechanism** over the ODE-derived state trajectory, where the agent learns to weigh past velocity and derivative predictions dynamically, using a **multi-head attention layer** with a fixed time window of 100 timesteps and a learning rate of 3e-4. This builds on the success..."
