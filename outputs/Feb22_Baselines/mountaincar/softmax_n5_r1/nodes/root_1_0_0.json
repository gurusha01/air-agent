  "strategy": "Introduce a temporal convolutional network (TCN) as a dynamics model that learns long-range temporal dependencies in the state transitions directly from raw sensor data (position and velocity), using a causal convolution architecture to predict the next state without any latent compression. The TCN is trained with a combination of MSE loss on state transitions and a temporal consistency regularization term. The policy network takes the raw (uncompressed) state and velocity inputs directly, with the TCN providing a dynamics prediction used to augment the experience replay buffer by adding synthetic transitions that preserve temporal flow. This approach avoids latent space compression and instead leverages structured temporal modeling to enhance trajectory coherence.",

This success suggests that explicitly enforcing physical dynamics\u2014such as energy conservation\u2014leads to more stable and physically plausible policies, enabling the agent to learn long-term strategies that avoid impossible or energy-violating trajectories. In contrast, **root_2** (TD3 with hierarchical state representation) failed, likely due to overcomplication and poor convergence in a high-dimensional, underdetermined environment where action history may not provide meaningful signals. The VAE-based data-driven model in **root_1_0** maintains the same high score (37.3346), indicating that even without explicit physics constraints, a strong state compression via VAEs can capture essential dynamics, suggesting that the underlying state space is effectively represented by latent features. However, since the VAE approach does not enforce physical laws, its performance may be fragile to noise or state shifts. The next concrete direction should be to **refine the VAE-based state-space model in root_1_0 by introducing a physics-aware latent space**, such as constraining the latent variables to preserve energy conservation (e.g., via a latent energy term in the VAE loss), and training the policy to respect this constraint during action selectio..."
