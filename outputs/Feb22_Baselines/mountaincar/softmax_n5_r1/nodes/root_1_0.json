  "strategy": "Replace the PINN-based dynamics model with a physics-free, data-driven state-space model using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to compress the observation space into latent dynamics. The VAE learns a latent representation of the state (position, velocity) and predicts the next state without enforcing physical laws. The policy network uses this latent state as input, and a reconstruction loss ensures the model preserves temporal consistency. This approach removes explicit physical constraints while still maintaining trajectory coherence, allowing the agent to explore more dynamically feasible regions without prior bias. Training uses PPO with an additional reconstruction penalty to stabilize learning.",

  "reflection": "The physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach in **root_1** has achieved the best score so far (37.3346), significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and the DDPG variant in **root_0** (32.9641), indicating that explicitly enforcing physical dynamics\u2014such as energy conservation\u2014leads to more stable and effective policies. This success suggests that aligning the policy with the underlying physics of the MountainCar system (e.g., energy balance between position, velocity, and potential energy) improves generalization and avoids unrealistic or unstable trajectories. In contrast, **root_2** (TD3 with hierarchical state representation) failed, likely due to overcomplicating the state space with action history without sufficient empirical validation or convergence guarantees. The failure of TD3 highlights that hierarchical or memory-based state encodings without clear physical grounding or proper regularization may introduce instability or overfitting. The next experiment should expand **root_1** by introducing a **physics-informed loss term that explicitly enforces energy conservation** (i.e., kinetic + potential energy = constant) during training, with a weighting of 0.1\u20130.3 on the policy loss, and use a **learning rate of 1e-4** and **batch size of 128** to ensure convergence. This refinement will test whether stronger physical constraints further improve performance beyond the current 37.3346 baseline."
