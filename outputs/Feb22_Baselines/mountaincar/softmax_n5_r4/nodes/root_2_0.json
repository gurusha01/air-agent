Use a double-layered MLP with ReLU activations and batch normalization to improve generalization, and introduce a momentum-based learning rate scheduler to stabilize training. Preprocess the state space by normalizing the position and velocity to zero mean and unit variance, and apply a tanh transformation to the action space to ensure bounded actions within [-1, 1]. This approach leverages deep learning's capacity to capture complex nonlinear dynamics in the MountainCarContinuous environment, moving beyond probabilistic modeling to a deterministic, data-driven policy.",

This approach worked because GPs naturally model uncertainty in the state-action mapping, allowing the policy to adapt dynamically to the environment\u2019s non-linear dynamics\u2014particularly useful in a domain like MountainCar where small, consistent actions are needed to overcome the energy barrier. In contrast, **root_0 (TD3)** and **root_1 (time-delayed reward shaping)** both failed, with no reported scores, suggesting that TD3 may struggle with the sparse, non-rewardable nature of the environment without proper baseline tuning, and reward shaping may introduce instability or misalignment with the true optimal policy. The failure of TD3\u2014despite its robustness in many continuous control tasks\u2014highlights that standard actor-critic methods may not generalize well to environments with no natural reward structure or long-term dependencies. Similarly, reward shaping introduced in root_1 likely led to suboptimal or misleading gradients, as incremental movement rewards may not reflect true progress toward the goal. The next concrete direction should be to **enhance the GP-based policy by incorporating a physics-informed prior**\u2014specifically, modeling the known dynamics of MountainCar (e.g., the physics equation of motion) as a Gaussian process kernel to i..."
