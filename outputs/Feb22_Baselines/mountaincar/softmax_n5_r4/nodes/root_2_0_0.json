The attention layers learn long-term dependencies in the dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment, enabling better trajectory planning. The action output is mapped via a final linear layer with tanh activation to ensure bounded actions. Use a critic network with a similar structure but with a separate temporal encoder. Train using PPO with a learning rate scheduler based on adaptive gradient clipping to prevent instability during exploration.",

  "reflection": "1. The only successful experiment so far is **root_2**, which achieved a reward mean of **14.9956** using a Gaussian Process (GP)-based policy with Bayesian optimization. This approach likely worked because GPs naturally model uncertainty in the state-action dynamics of MountainCarContinuous, allowing the policy to adapt robustly to the environment\u2019s non-linear and sparse reward structure, especially in regions where data is scarce. The Bayesian optimization framework efficiently explores the action space, avoiding poor local optima.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed include **root_0** (TD3) and **root_1** (time-delayed reward shaping). TD3 failed with a score of **FAIL**, likely due to the inherent difficulty of continuous control in MountainCar\u2014where the action space is narrow and the environment requires precise, long-term policy learning without sufficient exploration. Reward shaping in **root_1** failed with a score of **FAIL**, suggesting that artificially introduced incremental rewards may have distorted the agent\u2019s learning, leading to suboptimal or unstable behavior, possibly due to reward hacking or misaligned objectives.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_2_0**, which scored **-595.3879**\u2014a catastrophic failure when replacing the GP policy with a PPO-based MLP. To fix this, we should try a **hybrid approach**: use a **small, shallow MLP (2 hidden layers, 64 units each, ReLU activation)** as a surrogate for the GP policy, but train it with **PPO..."
