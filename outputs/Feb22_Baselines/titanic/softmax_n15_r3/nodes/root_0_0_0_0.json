  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_2_1_0_0**, achieving a remarkable **0.9426 accuracy**, which significantly outperforms all other strategies. This success stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features\u2014especially in complex, high-dimensional inputs like age, fare, and cabin\u2014by learning compressed, meaningful embeddings that preserve survival-relevant structure. In contrast, approaches relying on traditional tree-based models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) with only original features or basic transformations (e.g., log transform, target encoding) plateau at **0.85\u20130.87**, indicating that standard feature engineering is insufficient for the Titanic dataset\u2019s underlying complexity.  \n\nConsistently failing strategies include **stacked autoencoders (SAE)** at **root_0_0_0 (0.6675)** and **deep neural networks with wavelet transforms (root_2_0_1, 0.6244)**, both of which underperform even baseline models, suggesting that unsupervised feature learning without proper downstream integration or that overcomplicates simple data patterns fails to generalize. Additionally, SVMs with RBF kernels and feature selection (**root_1_1, 0.7416**) perform poorly, likely due to their sensitivity to feature scale and inability to model complex non-linear interactions effectively.  \n\nThe next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0** by replacing the stacked autoencoder with a **deep autoencoder (DAE) us..."
