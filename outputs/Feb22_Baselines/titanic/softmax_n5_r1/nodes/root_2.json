  "reflection": "Gradient-boosted tree models, particularly XGBoost or LightGBM with categorical feature hashing and target encoding for *Embarked* and *Pclass*, have delivered the best performance (0.8493), indicating that tree-based methods effectively capture non-linear interactions and handle categorical variables when properly encoded. This success stems from their ability to model complex feature interactions\u2014especially with engineered terms\u2014without requiring extensive feature engineering. In contrast, the neural network approach (root_1) failed outright, likely due to insufficient data size, poor embedding dimension choices, or overfitting from lack of regularization in the feedforward architecture. Neural networks with embeddings are not well-suited for the small, structured nature of the Titanic dataset, where sparse categorical features lack sufficient signal for deep learning. The next experiment should expand on root_0 by introducing **polynomial interaction terms** (e.g., *Pclass* \u00d7 *SibSp*, *Age* \u00d7 *Fare*) and applying **feature scaling** (e.g., StandardScaler) to continuous variables before feeding into the LightGBM model, as this has shown promise in similar tabular datasets. This specific direction is grounded in the observation that interaction terms improve accuracy in tree models by capturing survival patterns (e.g., elderly passengers with high fares). Hyperparameters to tune include `learning_rate=0.05`, `max_depth=6`, and `num_leaves=128`, based on prior performance in ..."
