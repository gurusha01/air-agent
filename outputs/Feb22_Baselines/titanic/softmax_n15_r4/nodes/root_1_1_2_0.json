Instead of PCA, apply a tree-based feature transformation that automatically detects non-linear relationships and interactions between numerical features (like age and fare) and categorical variables (like class and gender). This approach leverages the interpretability and strong performance on tabular data with sparse outcomes, while avoiding the assumptions of linear PCA. Use out-of-bag (OOB) score for validation and tune hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is **root_1_1_2** with a score of **0.9593**, which uses a **light-dimensional PCA-based feature transformation** on numerical features (age, fare) followed by a **Bayesia**-based model (likely Bayesian network or Bayesian inference). This approach works exceptionally well because PCA effectively reduces noise and captures latent variance patterns in age and fare, which are highly correlated with survival, while preserving the most discriminative information. In contrast, deep unsupervised methods like autoencoders (root_1_1_1) and Transformers (root_1_1_1_0) underperform significantly (0.6483 and 0.6435), indicating that complex, sequence-based or latent feature learning is not effective here due to the small, sparse, and structured nature of the Titanic dataset.  \n\nModels relying on deep architectures (e.g., neural networks with autoencoders or Transformers) or complex feature engineering (e.g., familial GNNs) have consistently failed or underperformed, especially when applied without strong baseline feature engineering. The **root_1_1_1_0_0** (GNN with familial relationships) and **root_1_1_1** (deep autoencoder) both fail with scores below 0.64, suggesting that graph-based or deep unsupervised learning is not suitable for this problem due to lack of clear relational structure and small sample size.  \n\nThe next experiment should **refine the PCA-based transformation in root_1_1_2** by applying **PCA with 2\u20134 components** (based on explai..."
