  "reflection": "The deep neural network approach (root_1: 0.9569) has been the most successful, demonstrating superior performance by effectively modeling complex, non-linear interactions among features through multi-layer perceptrons with dropout and batch normalization\u2014key techniques for preventing overfitting and capturing high-dimensional patterns. In contrast, gradient boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) like those in root_1_1_0 (0.8756) show promise but fall short of the neural network baseline, likely due to their limited capacity to model intricate feature interactions beyond tree-based splits. Notably, attempts using autoencoders (root_1_1_1: 0.6483) or Transformers (root_1_1_1_0: 0.6435) failed to improve performance, suggesting that unsupervised feature learning on raw passenger data is ineffective for this task. The random forest and gradient-boosted tree variants (root_0, root_1_0, root_2_0) consistently failed or underperformed, indicating that tree-based models lack the expressive power needed for the Titanic dataset\u2019s non-linear dynamics. The next experiment should expand root_1_1_0 by applying polynomial feature expansion (e.g., degree-2 interactions) on key continuous features like *Age*, *Fare*, and *SibSp*, and then fine-tuning the XGBoost model with learning rate = 0.01, max_depth = 6, and subsample = 0.8 to better capture non-linear patterns without overfitting. This targeted combination of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning builds on the 0.8756 baselin..."
