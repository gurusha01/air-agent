  "strategy": "Replace the random forest with a gradient boosting machine (GBM) such as XGBoost or LightGBM, and apply target encoding with smoothing to handle categorical variables. Introduce polynomial features of degree 2 for continuous variables (e.g., Age\u00b2, Fare\u00b2) and interaction terms between continuous features (e.g., Age \u00d7 Fare) to capture non-linear relationships. Use robust scaling (RobustScaler) instead of min-max to preserve tail behavior, and impute missing values using a median-based approach for continuous features and mode-based imputation for categorical ones. This combination leverages the strong predictive power of gradient boosting while improving stability in the presence of outliers and sparse data.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the random forest ensemble with target encoding and interaction features (root_0_1: 0.8780), which outperforms gradient boosting (0.8756) and neural network approaches, indicating that tree-based models with feature engineering\u2014particularly interaction terms derived from factorization\u2014capture complex non-linear relationships in the data more effectively than deep models. Target encoding for categorical variables like 'Pclass', 'Sex', and 'Embarked' has proven highly effective, as it preserves class-level information without overfitting when combined with bagging. In contrast, neural networks with embeddings (root_1: 0.8421) and DNNs with MLPs (root_0_0: 0.8589) consistently underperform, likely due to overfitting on sparse categorical features and poor generalization without sufficient data augmentation or regularization. The failure of root_1_0 (replacing NN with XGBoost using engineered features) suggests that engineered features alone are not sufficient without proper encoding or feature scaling. The next experiment should expand root_0_1 by introducing **interaction features via factorization of categorical variables (e.g., 'Pclass' \u00d7 'Sex', 'Embarked' \u00d7 'Pclass')** and applying **target encoding with cross-validation to prevent leakage**, while maintaining the random forest ensemble with bagging. This specific direction leverages the proven success of interaction terms and target encoding in boosting accuracy to potentially exceed 0..."
