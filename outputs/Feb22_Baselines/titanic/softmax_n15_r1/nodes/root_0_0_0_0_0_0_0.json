The model learns how survival likelihoods are influenced by real-world physical constraints, using differential equations to guide the training process. This approach treats survival as a function of time and spatial dynamics, not just passenger demographics.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is the graph neural network (GNN) at **root_2_0_0_0**, achieving a remarkable **0.9545 accuracy**, which far exceeds baseline and other models. This success stems from effectively modeling social relationships\u2014such as family ties or cabin proximity\u2014as edges in a passenger graph, capturing latent dependencies that traditional models miss. In contrast, approaches like KNN (**root_2: 0.6172**) and random forests with only categorical features (**root_2_1: FAIL**) have failed due to poor generalization and inability to capture continuous or relational patterns. The hybrid attention model (**root_0_0_0_0_0_0**) and GNN with shared cabin edges (**root_0_0_0_0_0_0**) both plateaued at **0.8421**, indicating that while social structure is important, adding temporal or attention mechanisms without strong relational grounding yields limited gains. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0_0_0_0** by introducing **edge-weighted GNNs** where edge weights are derived from the *distance between cabins* (using Euclidean distance in the cabin location space) and *family size*, and use **graph pooling layers** to aggregate node features across family groups. This leverages both spatial and social proximity with concrete, measurable features, building on the proven value of relational modeling while addressing the limitations of prior attempts."
