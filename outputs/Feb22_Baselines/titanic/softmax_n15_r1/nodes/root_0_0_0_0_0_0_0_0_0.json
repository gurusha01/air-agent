  "strategy": "Introduce a temporal graph neural network (TGNN) that models the Titanic disaster as a sequence of events over time, where passengers are nodes and their interactions (e.g., boarding order, proximity, or movement patterns) are captured as time-varying edges. The TGNN learns survival by tracking how passenger behavior evolves over time, such as delayed boarding or group movements during the sinking, incorporating temporal dynamics that previous GNNs ignore. This approach emphasizes dynamic social interactions rather than static familial relationships.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is the graph neural network (GNN) at **root_2_0_0_0** with a score of **0.9545**, which leverages passenger relationships as edges in a social network\u2014specifically modeling familial or cabin-proximity links. This outperforms all other models because it captures unobserved social dependencies (e.g., siblings or shared cabins) that traditional models miss. In contrast, approaches like **KNN (root_2: 0.6172)** and **random forests on categorical features (root_2_1: FAIL)** have failed due to poor scalability, lack of interaction modeling, or inability to handle continuous and categorical feature integration. The **neural network with embeddings (root_1: FAIL)** also failed, likely due to overfitting or poor embedding initialization on sparse categorical features. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0** by introducing **a GNN with edge types**\u2014specifically distinguishing between familial (e.g., spouse, sibling) and non-familial (e.g., cabin proximity) relationships\u2014using features like `sibsp`, `parch`, and `cabin` proximity, and applying **graph convolution layers with attention mechanisms** to prioritize high-impact social ties. This builds directly on the success of the GNN at root_2_0_0_0 while refining edge definition and model interpretability."
