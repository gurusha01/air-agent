  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid attention-based model that combines temporal embeddings with class-specific survival patterns by applying a multi-head attention mechanism over passenger features (e.g., age, fare, class) while incorporating time-of-boarding as a dynamic input. This model learns cross-attribute dependencies (e.g., how high fare interacts with class and boarding time) using self-attention, enabling it to identify subtle survival cues that emerge from interactions across features rather than linear or sequential patterns. This approach fundamentally differs from time-series transformers by focusing on feature interaction dynamics rather than event sequences.",

  "reflection": "The gradient-boosted tree models (XGBoost/LightGBM) with targeted feature interactions\u2014particularly cross-products between *age* and *passenger class*\u2014have delivered the best performance (0.8421), demonstrating that structured feature engineering and tree-based models excel at capturing non-linear, interaction-driven patterns in survival data. This success is likely due to the models' ability to handle both numerical and categorical features effectively, especially when engineered features like *age_class* capture meaningful passenger risk profiles. In contrast, approaches like KNN (0.8206) and neural networks without proper embedding or structure (FAIL) have underperformed or failed, indicating that over-reliance on distance-based or shallow architectures lacks the capacity to model complex survival dependencies. The time-series transformer model (root_0_0_0_0) currently holds a score of 0.8421 but has not been validated beyond the baseline\u2014its assumption that survival is sequence-dependent lacks empirical support in this dataset, where passenger records are independent. Therefore, the next experiment should specifically expand root_0_0_0_0 by introducing a **time-aware attention mechanism** that models *passenger age and fare trends* across class groups using a lightweight transformer, while keeping the same cross-product features (e.g., age \u00d7 class) and using a small, interpretable architecture to avoid overfitting. This maintains the proven strength of interaction feature..."
