This approach shifts from feature-level interactions to relational dynamics, fundamentally differing from attention-based or traditional ML models.",

  "reflection": "The gradient-boosted tree models, particularly the XGBoost/LightGBM with cross-product features (e.g., age \u00d7 passenger class), have consistently achieved the highest accuracy (0.8421), demonstrating that targeted feature engineering and tree-based models excel at capturing non-linear interactions in survival patterns. This success stems from the ability of gradient-boosted trees to handle mixed feature types (numerical and categorical) and model complex, non-linear relationships without requiring explicit embedding or sequence modeling. In contrast, approaches like KNN (0.8206) and random forests on categorical-only features (FAIL) underperform or fail due to poor scalability and inability to model continuous interactions. Neural networks with embeddings (root_1: FAIL) and GNNs (root_0_0_0: 0.8421) have not improved performance despite theoretical promise, likely due to overfitting or lack of relevant passenger relationship structure. The hybrid attention model (root_0_0_0_0_0: 0.8421) maintains the top score, suggesting that multi-head attention applied to temporal or class-specific patterns is effective when combined with strong baseline features. The next experiment should specifically expand root_0_0_0_0_0 by introducing **temporal attention over passenger boarding order** (e.g., using a sequence of passengers by embarkation port or class) and **attentively weighting survival patterns by class and gender**, using only the features (age, fare, class, gender, port) with pro..."
