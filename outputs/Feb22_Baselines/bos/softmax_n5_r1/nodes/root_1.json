  "reflection": "1. The mixed strategy in root_0 (score: 0.7234) with a 0.7 probability of \"Coordination\" failed to improve upon the baseline (1.0227), suggesting that simple uniform randomization or fixed probabilistic choices do not align with the game's equilibrium or strategic incentives. This indicates that naive mixing without considering payoff structures or opponent behavior is ineffective.\n\n2. Approaches relying on uniform or arbitrary probability distributions (e.g., 0.7/0.3 split without justification) have consistently underperformed, as they ignore the asymmetric payoffs in the Battle of Sexes where coordination yields higher joint rewards. Any strategy that fails to account for the value of mutual preference or the risk of misalignment has been dismissed due to low scores.\n\n3. The next experiment should test a **payoff-weighted mixed strategy** where the row player selects \"Coordination\" with probability proportional to the expected payoff difference between coordination and conflict, using the actual payoff matrix (e.g., 4,2 vs. 1,3). Specifically, compute the probability as (2 / (2 + 1)) = 0.67 for Coordination, based on the row player's preference for higher joint rewards. This should be evaluated against the baseline (1.0227) to determine if it improves score beyond 0.7234."
