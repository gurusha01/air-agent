  "reflection": "The dynamic adaptive strategy in root_1 achieved a score of 0.7933, which is significantly better than the baseline (1.0227) and the mixed strategy in root_0 (0.7234), suggesting that behavioral adaptation based on opponent history\u2014specifically reinforcement learning with a simple rule (e.g., favoring \"Coordination\" if opponent chose it previously)\u2014has some effectiveness in exploiting patterns. However, this still falls short of the baseline, indicating that the current adaptive rule is too simplistic and fails to capture deeper strategic dynamics. Mixed strategies with fixed probabilities (like root_0\u2019s 0.7/0.3) perform worse, likely because they lack responsiveness to opponent behavior and fail to exploit coordination opportunities in real time. The consistent failure of static mixed strategies suggests that pre-defined probability distributions without learning or feedback loops are suboptimal in a dynamic, interactive setting. The next experiment should expand from the root node with a **context-aware reinforcement learning agent** that uses a small neural network (e.g., a 2-layer MLP with ReLU activation) to predict opponent behavior based on past moves, with a learning rate of 0.01 and a discount factor of 0.95, and updates the row player\u2019s choice using a Q-learning update rule based on observed payoffs. This approach directly builds on the promising signal from root_1 but improves the model\u2019s capacity to generalize and adapt, aiming to recover or exceed the baseline sc..."
