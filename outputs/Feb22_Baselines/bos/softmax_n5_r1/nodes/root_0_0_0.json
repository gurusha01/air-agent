  "strategy": "Introduce a phase-based cyclic strategy where the row player alternates between two fixed probabilities in a 3-phase cycle: Phase 1 (20% chance of Coordination), Phase 2 (50% chance of Coordination), Phase 3 (80% chance of Coordination), repeating every 3 rounds. The phase transition is triggered by the column player's action in the previous round: if they chose Coordination, the cycle advances; otherwise, it resets to Phase 1. This introduces periodicity and exploits potential preference inertia in the column player, creating predictable yet non-repeating patterns that may trigger coordination through habit formation.",

  "reflection": "The time-dependent adaptive mixed strategy in **root_0_0** (score: 0.8612) has emerged as the best-performing approach so far, significantly outperforming baseline (1.0227) and other adaptive methods. This success stems from its dynamic adjustment of \"Coordination\" probability based on the column player\u2019s past actions\u2014specifically, it likely uses a simple reinforcement learning or feedback loop that updates probabilities in real time, enabling better exploitation of opponent patterns. In contrast, frequency-based learning (root_2: 0.7279) and basic uniform mixed strategies (root_0: 0.7234) fail to adapt quickly enough to opponent behavior, resulting in lower scores due to lack of responsiveness. Dynamic adaptive strategies (root_1: 0.7933) show promise but fall short because they lack fine-grained temporal sensitivity or explicit coordination tracking. The consistent failure of static or low-frequency learning models suggests that real-time, history-aware adaptation is critical. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0** by introducing a **sliding window of the last 5 moves** for the column player, with a **learning rate of 0.1** and a **probability update rule using exponential smoothing**, to refine the dynamic adjustment mechanism and test whether increased temporal sensitivity improves score beyond 0.8612."
