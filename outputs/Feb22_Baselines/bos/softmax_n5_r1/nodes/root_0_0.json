Specifically, if the column player chose \"Coordination\" in the previous round, the row player increases the probability of choosing \"Coordination\" by 0.1 (capped at 0.9); otherwise, it decreases by 0.1 (capped at 0.1). This leverages behavioral feedback to anticipate the column player's preferences and exploits their coordination bias through sequential learning.",

  "reflection": "The dynamic adaptive strategy in **root_1** (score: 0.7933) outperformed both frequency-based and mixed strategies, suggesting that real-time adaptation based on opponent behavior\u2014specifically using reinforcement learning to update choices after observing \"Coordination\" in prior rounds\u2014captures exploitable patterns more effectively than static or historical averaging. This indicates that learning from immediate feedback and adjusting behavior in a rule-based manner (e.g., increasing coordination probability after opponent coordination) yields better outcomes than pre-defined mixed strategies. In contrast, **root_2** (0.7279) and **root_0** (0.7234) failed to leverage temporal dynamics, relying instead on static or historical frequencies, which likely miss short-term shifts in opponent behavior. These approaches are particularly ineffective in a game with asymmetric payoffs where coordination is only beneficial under specific conditions. The next experiment should expand **root_0** by introducing a **time-decay weighted frequency update**\u2014where the row player updates their choice probability using only the last 20 rounds of opponent behavior, with a decay factor of 0.95, to balance responsiveness and stability. This combines the simplicity of frequency learning with a more adaptive, memory-efficient mechanism, directly addressing the limitations of uniform mixed strategies while avoiding overfitting to outdated data. This specific modification targets the gap between static ba..."
