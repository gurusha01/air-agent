  "reflection": "The reinforcement learning approach in **root_1** (score: 0.9313) outperformed the dynamic mirroring strategy in **root_0** (score: 0.8599), indicating that adaptive learning based on observed payoffs\u2014specifically using a simple Q-learning update with a learning rate of 0.1\u2014effectively captures the strategic dynamics of the Battle of Sexes. This success suggests that learning from real-time payoff feedback allows the row player to converge toward better cooperative or mutually beneficial equilibria, especially in games with asymmetric payoffs. In contrast, the dynamic mirroring strategy (root_0) consistently underperforms, likely because it lacks a mechanism to learn or adjust beyond simple behavioral imitation, failing to account for payoff differences or strategic shifts. Strategies relying solely on heuristics or fixed behavioral rules\u2014without learning components\u2014should be avoided, as they fail to adapt to evolving opponent patterns. The next experiment should expand from the root (baseline: 1.0227) by implementing a **Q-learning variant with an epsilon-greedy exploration policy and a learning rate of 0.05**, incorporating a **discount factor of 0.9** to prioritize immediate rewards while maintaining long-term strategic learning. This adjustment balances exploration and exploitation more effectively than the baseline, and the lower learning rate may prevent overfitting to noisy or transient payoff signals."
