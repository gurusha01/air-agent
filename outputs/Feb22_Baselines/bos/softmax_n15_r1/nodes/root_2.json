Otherwise, they default to a uniform 0.5 probability. This strategy leverages behavioral pattern recognition and temporal dependency.",

  "reflection": "The mixed strategy based on calibrated Bayesian updates (root_0: 0.9399) has performed best so far, outperforming the time-varying dynamic strategy (root_1: 0.6909), indicating that static, data-driven probabilistic choices informed by historical preferences are more effective than adaptive, lag-based adjustments. This success suggests that Bayesian calibration\u2014specifically, using past observed choices to estimate the column player\u2019s preference probabilities\u2014provides a stable and reliable foundation for strategy selection. In contrast, time-varying strategies, which rely on lagged historical signals and dynamic weighting, have failed to improve performance and appear to overcomplicate the model without sufficient signal, likely due to noise in short-term behavioral patterns. The baseline (1.0227) is actually higher than both children, which implies that the current baseline may be a well-tuned default strategy, possibly incorporating prior knowledge or heuristics that outperform even the best Bayesian model. Therefore, any new experiment should avoid introducing complex time-series dynamics or overfitting to short-term patterns. Instead, the next experiment should test a **Bayesian mixed strategy with a hyperparameter-tuned prior**\u2014specifically, adjusting the prior belief on the column player\u2019s preference (e.g., initial probability of preferring \"Movie\") from 0.5 to 0.7 or 0.3, and evaluating how this impacts the posterior probability and resulting score.
