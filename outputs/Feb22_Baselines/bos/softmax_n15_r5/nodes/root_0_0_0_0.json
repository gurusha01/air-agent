The row player then selects cooperation with probability proportional to the posterior belief that the column player prefers coordination, incorporating a temporal smoothing term to avoid overfitting to short-term noise. This strategy leverages probabilistic graphical models to capture unobserved behavioral patterns and adapts to shifts in the column player's preferences over time.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategies so far are **temporal difference learning with eligibility traces (TDE)** and **Bayesian belief updating**, achieving scores of **1.4072** and **1.4003**, respectively. These methods outperform baseline and simpler approaches because they explicitly model long-term opponent behavior and uncertainty, enabling adaptive, context-aware decisions that capture evolving patterns in the opponent\u2019s strategy. In contrast, approaches like **behavioral cloning** (score: 0.5974) and **AR(1) autoregressive models** (FAIL) have consistently failed\u2014either due to poor generalization or inability to handle non-stationary or complex opponent dynamics. The **RNN-based LSTM** (score: 0.3209) also underperformed, suggesting that even sophisticated temporal modeling without proper reward shaping or belief updating fails to converge. Given that TDE and Bayesian methods achieve high scores by modeling uncertainty and long-term dependencies, the next experiment should **expand root_0_0_0**\u2014a reinforcement learning strategy with a sliding window of the column player\u2019s actions\u2014by **introducing eligibility traces to the Q-learning updates**, specifically using a trace decay parameter (\u03bb = 0.9) and a time window of 5 rounds to maintain persistent memory of opponent behavior. This hybrid approach combines the temporal sensitivity of the sliding window with the long-term dependency capture of TDE, directly addressing the weakness of the current root_0_0_0 (0.8948) by enabling ..."
