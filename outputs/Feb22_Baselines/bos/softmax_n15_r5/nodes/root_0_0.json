  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **root_2_0** with a score of **1.4072**, which uses **temporal difference learning with eligibility traces (TDE)** to model longer-term opponent behavior. This outperforms baseline (1.0227) by over 37%, suggesting that capturing delayed dependencies in opponent actions\u2014rather than reacting to immediate feedback\u2014is critical. In contrast, approaches like **behavioral cloning (root_2_1: 0.5974)** and **RNNs with LSTM (root_2_0_0: 0.3209)** fail dramatically, indicating that direct imitation or shallow temporal modeling without proper reward shaping or credit assignment does not work. The **dynamic entropy-based strategy (root_2_1_0: 1.3125)** performs well but still lags behind TDE, suggesting that while uncertainty modeling helps, it's insufficient without temporal memory. Strategies relying on fixed mixed strategies (e.g., root_0: 0.8040) or random walks (root_1_0: 0.8044) consistently underperform, showing that static or stochastic policies fail to adapt to opponent dynamics. The next experiment should **expand root_0** by introducing **a time-dependent mixed strategy** where the row player adjusts cooperation probability based on a **moving window of the last 3 rounds of the column player\u2019s actions**, using a **linear regression model with lagged features** to predict opponent behavior and update action probabilities in real time. This combines the simplicity of mixed strategies with adaptive learning, leveraging the high baseline score..."
