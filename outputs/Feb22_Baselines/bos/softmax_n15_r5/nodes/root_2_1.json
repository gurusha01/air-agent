  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **temporal difference learning with eligibility traces (TDE)**, achieving a score of **1.4072**, significantly outperforming the baseline (1.0227). This success stems from its ability to model longer-term dependencies in opponent behavior by maintaining eligibility traces, allowing the model to update Q-values not just after immediate interactions but based on delayed consequences\u2014critical in the Battle of Sexes where coordination over time is key. In contrast, the **random walk-based strategy (root_1_0: 0.8044)** and **time-dependent dynamic strategy (root_1: 0.8469)** consistently fail due to their inability to adapt to opponent patterns effectively, showing poor score stability and convergence. The **baseline mixed strategy (root_0: 0.8040)** performs poorly because it ignores historical context and opponent behavior entirely. The **reinforcement learning-based strategy (root_2: 1.3803)** shows promise but still lags behind TDE, suggesting that standard Q-learning without eligibility traces fails to capture temporal dynamics. Therefore, the next experiment should **expand root_2 by introducing eligibility traces into the Q-learning framework**, specifically using a trace decay parameter (\u03bb = 0.9) and a learning rate (\u03b1 = 0.1) to balance exploration and long-term memory, to directly replicate and improve upon the TDE success while maintaining computational feasibility. This targeted refinement leverages the proven efficacy of temporal ..."
