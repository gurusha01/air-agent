  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_0 with a row player\u2019s mixed strategy of cooperating with probability 0.6\u2014achieved a score of 0.8040, significantly below the baseline of 1.0227, indicating that randomization alone is insufficient to exploit the game\u2019s structure. This suggests that static mixed strategies fail to account for the column player\u2019s potential adaptive responses or the asymmetric payoffs in the Battle of Sexes. Approaches involving full game-theoretic equilibrium (e.g., Nash equilibria) or dynamic learning models have not been tested, and thus remain unexplored. Notably, any strategy that assumes symmetry or ignores the column player\u2019s incentives has consistently underperformed, as seen in symmetric randomization or pure strategy trials. What has failed is any strategy that ignores the strategic interdependence\u2014such as assuming the column player will always respond predictably. The next experiment should test a **reinforcement learning (RL) approach** where both players learn iteratively via Q-learning, with a learning rate of 0.1, discount factor of 0.9, and a reward function directly tied to the Score metric (i.e., maximizing joint payoff). Specifically, initialize both players with a uniform exploration policy (\u03b5 = 0.3), and run 10,000 rounds of interaction to allow for convergence, aiming to achieve a score above 0.9000 by leveraging adaptive responses to opponent behavior. This builds on the insight that static mixed strategies are suboptimal and direct..."
