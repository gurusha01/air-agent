  "reflection": "The reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategy in **root_2** achieved the best score of **1.3803**, significantly outperforming baseline (1.0227), demonstrating that adaptive learning based on opponent behavior\u2014specifically using **Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration**\u2014is highly effective in the Battle of Sexes. This success stems from the model\u2019s ability to learn and exploit patterns in the column player\u2019s responses over time, particularly in non-symmetric or non-cooperative scenarios where static strategies fail. In contrast, **root_0** (mixed strategy with fixed 0.6 cooperation) and **root_1** (time-dependent dynamic strategy) underperformed, with scores of **0.8040** and **0.8469**, respectively, indicating that rigid or history-based adjustments without learning dynamics fail to capture the strategic nuances. The failure of root_1 suggests that simply adjusting payoff expectations based on lagged history without reinforcement learning mechanisms does not yield sufficient adaptation. Moving forward, the next experiment should expand **root_1** by introducing **a time-dependent Q-learning framework** where the row player updates their action probabilities using lagged opponent actions as state features, with a learning rate of **0.1** and epsilon decay from **0.1 to 0.01 over 1000 episodes**, to combine dynamic responsiveness with adaptive learning. This hybrid approach directly addresses the shortcomings of root_1 by embedding reinforcement learning into the time-d..."
