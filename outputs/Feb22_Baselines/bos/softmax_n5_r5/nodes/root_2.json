  "reflection": "The mixed strategy approach in **root_0** (score: 0.9376) has performed best so far, outperforming the dynamic adaptive strategy in root_1 (0.9204), suggesting that a well-calibrated Bayesian update of the opponent\u2019s preferences\u2014without real-time adaptation\u2014is more effective than reactive, move-dependent adjustments. This implies that overfitting to short-term behavioral patterns (e.g., past moves) may introduce noise and reduce stability. In contrast, strategies relying on real-time feedback (e.g., updating probabilities based on opponent\u2019s last move) have consistently underperformed, likely due to insufficient data or overfitting to transient behavior. The baseline (1.0227) is significantly higher than any child, indicating that the current baseline strategy\u2014possibly a simple, symmetric equilibrium or default policy\u2014outperforms both adaptive and mixed strategies, which suggests that the adaptive mechanisms may be misaligned with the true underlying dynamics. Therefore, the next experiment should **test a hybrid strategy** that combines a Bayesian belief update (like root_0) with a small, bounded adjustment to the cooperation probability after observing a deviation from expected behavior\u2014specifically, increasing the cooperation probability by 0.1 if the opponent defects after cooperating, but only if the defect is statistically rare (e.g., <10% of past defections). This maintains the stability of the baseline while introducing minimal, data-driven responsiveness. The hyperpa..."
