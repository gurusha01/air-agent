  "reflection": "1. The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_0 with a score of 0.9376\u2014relies on a calibrated Bayesian update of the column player\u2019s past preferences to determine a mixed strategy (60% cooperate, 40% defect). This approach works because it dynamically adapts to observed behavior, capturing the asymmetric incentives in the Battle of Sexes where coordination is key. The Bayesian calibration likely accounts for prior beliefs and observed deviations, leading to more responsive and context-aware decisions than static strategies.\n\n2. Static strategies (e.g., always cooperate or always defect) and purely heuristic rule-based approaches have consistently underperformed, with scores dropping below 0.90. Similarly, strategies relying on simple frequency matching without Bayesian updating fail to account for the underlying preference shifts, resulting in poor coordination and lower scores. These approaches lack adaptability and fail to exploit the dynamic nature of the game.\n\n3. The next experiment should test a **Bayesian strategy with adaptive learning rate**\u2014specifically, a variant of the root_0 approach where the learning rate in the posterior update is dynamically adjusted using a decay function (e.g., exponential decay with hyperparameter \u03b1 = 0.1) based on the variance of observed preferences. This should be evaluated with a score target of at least 0.95, using a 100-round simulation with observed preference data from the prior 50 rounds to calibrate the initial belief and update th..."
