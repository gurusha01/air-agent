  "reflection": "The time-varying mixed strategy in root_0 (score: 1.0117) underperformed the baseline (1.0227), suggesting that dynamic randomization with coordination and deviation shifts does not effectively exploit the game\u2019s structure\u2014likely because it fails to capture the asymmetric incentives or timing dynamics inherent in the Battle of Sexes. This approach, while theoretically sound, lacks sufficient adaptability to the players\u2019 evolving preferences or payoff asymmetries. In contrast, static strategies or simple coordination incentives (e.g., fixed probability of choosing the same action) have not been tested but may offer more stable performance. Notably, any strategy involving rigid dominance pursuit without coordination has failed, as it leads to suboptimal outcomes due to misaligned incentives. The next experiment should test a **time-varying mixed strategy with adaptive weights**, where the probability of coordination increases logarithmically with the column player\u2019s observed past cooperation, using a learning rate of 0.05 and a decay factor of 0.95, to better align with observed behavior. This builds on root_0\u2019s structure but introduces adaptive learning to improve score toward the baseline of 1.0227. A concrete target is to achieve at least 1.0200 by incorporating a moving average of past coordination signals with a 3-period window."
