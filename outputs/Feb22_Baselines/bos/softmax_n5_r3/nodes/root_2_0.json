  "reflection": "The dynamic response mechanism in **root_1** (score: 1.4404) has been the most successful, outperforming all others by over 40% relative gain, because it leverages a simple moving average of the last 3 column player actions to adjust the row player\u2019s strategy in real time\u2014effectively capturing short-term patterns and enabling adaptive coordination. In contrast, **root_0_0** (1.0360) and **root_0** (1.0117) use frequency-dependent or time-varying mixed strategies, which are too slow or overly stochastic to exploit consistent opponent behavior, resulting in suboptimal coordination. The reinforcement learning (RL) approach in **root_2** (score: 0.1813) has catastrophically failed\u2014likely due to poor initialization, lack of exploration balance, and insufficient reward shaping, leading to unstable learning and poor convergence. This suggests that RL without proper hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate = 0.1, discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9, exploration \u03b5 = 0.1) and a well-defined reward function (e.g., based on payoff differences, not raw action outcomes) fails to generalize in the Battle of Sexes\u2019 coordination dilemma. The next experiment should expand **root_2** by implementing a **Q-learning agent with a reward function that penalizes deviation from coordination when both players have a history of mutual choice**, using a fixed window of 5 past rounds, a learning rate of 0.05, and \u03b5-greedy exploration decaying from 0.3 to 0.05 over 100 rounds. This maintains the RL framework but gr..."
