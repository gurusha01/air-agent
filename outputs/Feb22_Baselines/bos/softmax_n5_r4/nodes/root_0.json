Specifically, the probability of choosing the preferred action (e.g., going to the movies) increases with a sine wave over time, peaking every 4 rounds, to exploit the column player's potential pattern recognition and induce uncertainty. This introduces dynamic unpredictability without relying on static or fixed probability distributions.",
