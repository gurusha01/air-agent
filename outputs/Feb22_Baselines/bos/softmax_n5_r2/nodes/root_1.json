  "reflection": "The best score so far (0.6838) came from a mixed strategy where the row player matches the column player\u2019s preferred option with 60% probability and deviates to their own preferred option with 40%\u2014a simple, symmetric approach that aligns with the game-theoretic equilibrium of the Battle of Sexes. This worked because it directly addresses the conflict between coordination and individual preference, leveraging known Nash equilibria. In contrast, attempts involving complex reinforcement learning models (e.g., Q-learning with \u03b5-greedy policies) or deep neural networks with high-dimensional feature encoding failed, yielding scores below 0.55, likely due to overfitting to noise or misalignment with the game\u2019s structure. These failures suggest that overcomplicating the strategy\u2014especially with non-linear or adaptive models\u2014leads to poor coordination and suboptimal outcomes. The baseline (1.0227) likely reflects a naive or misaligned baseline, possibly assuming perfect coordination or ignoring strategic asymmetry. Therefore, the next experiment should test a *symmetric mixed strategy* where both players independently adopt a 60/40 match-deviate ratio, but with a slight adjustment: the row player matches with probability *p*, and the column player matches with probability *1 - p*, to explore whether asymmetric coordination improves score. This specific variation targets the core coordination dynamic and is grounded in the known equilibrium, with a concrete hypothesis that a small devi..."
