This suggests that simple behavioral pattern modeling fails to capture the strategic dynamics of the Battle of Sexes, where coordination requires mutual trust and signaling, not just reactive probability adjustments. Approaches relying on historical opponent behavior (e.g., frequency-based prediction) have consistently underperformed, likely because the game\u2019s structure is inherently non-stationary and involves asymmetric payoffs. In contrast, strategies that assume full rationality or use equilibrium-based reasoning (e.g., Nash equilibrium) have not been tested yet and may offer better foundations. The failure of observed pattern-based strategies implies that overfitting to short-term behavior is a critical flaw\u2014especially with small sample sizes (only 10 rounds). The next experiment should test a **reinforcement learning (RL) agent using Q-learning with a reward function that explicitly weights coordination outcomes (e.g., 10 points for mutual coordination, 1 point for conflict, 0 for misaligned choices)**, initialized with a uniform exploration rate (\u03b5 = 0.1), and trained over 500 rounds with state features including opponent\u2019s last 3 moves and current round parity.
