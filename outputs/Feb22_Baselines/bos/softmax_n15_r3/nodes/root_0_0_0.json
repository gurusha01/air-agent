This introduces randomness without direct observation of the column player's choices, making the strategy unpredictable and less exploitable. The randomness is not based on lagged history or patterns, but on internal noise, which breaks any temporal predictability.",

  "reflection": "The reinforcement learning (RL) approach in **root_2_0_0** achieved the best score of **1.3695**, significantly outperforming all others, demonstrating that learning a policy via Q-learning with a discounted reward function\u2014using the opponent\u2019s last two choices as state features\u2014effectively captures strategic dynamics. This success stems from the model\u2019s ability to learn long-term value functions and adapt to opponent behavior through trial and error, unlike static or rule-based strategies. In contrast, Markov chain models (e.g., **root_2_0**, **root_2_0_0_0**) and time-series informed strategies (e.g., **root_2**) underperformed, with scores peaking at **1.1061** and **1.2994**, respectively, indicating that modeling opponent transitions as a first-order Markov process fails to capture complex, non-stationary behavior. Time-dependent mixed strategies (e.g., **root_0_0**) with lagged history inputs only achieved **0.8232**, showing poor performance due to insufficient signal or overfitting to short-term patterns. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0** by incorporating **a state representation that includes both the opponent\u2019s last two choices and the round number**, and use **a Q-learning agent with a learning rate of 0.1, discount factor of 0.9, and epsilon-greedy exploration (\u03b5 = 0.1)** to enable adaptive learning from historical interactions, aiming to bridge the gap between the weak mixed strategy and the strong RL baseline.
