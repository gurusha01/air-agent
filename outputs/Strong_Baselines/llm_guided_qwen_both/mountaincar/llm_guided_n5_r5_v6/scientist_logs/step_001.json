  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT change the critic architecture unless you first verify that the policy can learn stable actions. The policy must be able to explore and exploit effectively \u2014 increasing its capacity is key. Ensure that the policy network is properly defined with the new units and that the model can be initialized without errors.",

  "memory_update": "Critic depth (128 units) improved reward from 33.79 to 51.39, showing that value function expressivity helps in learning long-term dynamics \u2014 but this only works if the policy can act on that information. This suggests that policy capacity is equally critical and should be tuned in parallel.",
  "reasoning": "The modification of the critic network to use 128 hidden units (instead of 256) led to a significant improvement in reward (from 33.7938 to 51.3875), suggesting that a deeper, more expressive value function helps the agent learn the required dynamics of the MountainCar environment. However, the original code had a bug in `param_count` \u2014 it was missing from the `Model` class, which indicates a design flaw in the architecture's utility for monitoring or debugging. The executor correctly identified and fixed the issue by using `model.init(...).values()` to count parameters, confirming that the network is now properly defined. This shows that architectural depth can improve performance, but only if the implementation is robust. No other dimensions (e.g., policy network, learning rate, batch size) were explored. The current solution is promising but may be limited by the fixed number of hidden layers and units. We have not yet tested policy network improvements, entropy regularization, or learning rate schedules.",

    "No training has been run, so no performance data exists. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests the default policy is insufficient, indicating that the agent lacks a learned policy capable of accumulating momentum. This implies that value function stability and policy gradient updates are likely underperforming\u2014supporting the need for a stronger critic architecture."

This will guide future hyperparameter and architecture decisions."
