Ensure the actor and critic share the same input layer but have separate heads. Keep the class name 'Model' unchanged.",

  "memory_update": "No training has been run, so no performance data exists. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests the default policy is insufficient, indicating that the agent lacks a learned policy capable of accumulating momentum. This implies that value function stability and policy gradient updates are likely underperforming\u2014supporting the need for a stronger critic architecture.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is from no model (default policy), indicating that the environment is challenging and requires a learned policy. Since no training has occurred, we cannot assess performance of any specific configuration or model. The current setup lacks any hyperparameter tuning, policy architecture changes, or training loop modifications. Thus, we must begin with a foundational improvement to the PPO training setup\u2014specifically, adjusting the learning rate, batch size, or buffer size to improve convergence in the MountainCarContinuous environment, which is known for its difficulty due to the need for long-term planning and small reward signals.",
