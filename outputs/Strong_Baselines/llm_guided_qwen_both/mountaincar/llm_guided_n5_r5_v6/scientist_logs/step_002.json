  "reasoning": "Both root_0 and root_1 achieved the same score (51.3875), indicating that deepening the critic (128 units) and deepening the actor (128 units) independently yield equivalent performance. However, the original baseline (33.79) suggests the default policy lacks momentum, and neither change fully addresses the policy's ability to learn continuous action dynamics. The value function improvements are likely due to better state estimation, but without a stronger policy, the agent cannot exploit that information effectively. No errors in the code were found during execution, and both nodes passed validation. This implies that network depth alone is not the limiting factor\u2014what's missing is likely policy stability, action-space exploration, or learning rate tuning. The current strategies focus only on network architecture, missing critical hyperparameter control (e.g., learning rate, batch size, or entropy coefficient).",

However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests the default policy is insufficient, indicating that the agent lacks a learned policy capable of accumulating momentum.

    "Critic depth (128 units) improved reward from 33.79 to 51.39, showing that value function expressivity helps in learning long-term dynamics \u2014 but this only works if the policy can act on that information. This suggests that policy capacity is equally critical and should be tuned in parallel."
