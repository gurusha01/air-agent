This implies that future improvements should focus on stabilizing training dynamics rather than simply increasing capacity.",
  "reasoning": "The critic and actor network depth (128 units) both achieved a reward mean of 51.39, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.79) and the learning rate increase (25.12). This indicates that network capacity\u2014specifically the expressivity of the value and policy functions\u2014is critical for learning the long-term dynamics of MountainCarContinuous. However, both deepened networks performed identically, suggesting that depth alone is not the bottleneck; instead, the policy may be learning to exploit value function signals effectively. The learning rate change failed, likely due to instability in policy updates\u2014too aggressive a step size prevents convergence. This implies that hyperparameter tuning (especially learning rate) must be paired with robust network architecture. No strategy involving network depth has been explored beyond 128 units. We have not yet tested network width (e.g., 512 units), activation functions, or normalization layers.",

    "No training has been run, so no performance data exists. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests the default policy is insufficient, indicating that the agent lacks a learned policy capable of accumulating momentum. This implies that value function stability and policy gradient updates are likely underperforming\u2014supporting the need for a stronger critic architecture.",
    "Critic depth (128 units) improved reward from 33.79 to 51.39, showing that value function expressivity helps in learning long-term dynamics \u2014 but this only works if the policy can act on that information. This suggests that policy capacity is equally critical and should be tuned in parallel.",
    "Deepening critic or actor to 128 units improved reward to 51.39, but both achieved identical results\u2014indicating that network depth is not the bottleneck; instead, learning dynamics (e.g., learning rate) are more critical for policy convergence in MountainCarContinuous."
