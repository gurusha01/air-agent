    "No training has been run, so no performance data exists. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests the default policy is insufficient, indicating that the agent lacks a learned policy capable of accumulating momentum. This implies that value function stability and policy gradient updates are likely underperforming\u2014supporting the need for a stronger critic architecture.",
    "Critic depth (128 units) improved reward from 33.79 to 51.39, showing that value function expressivity helps in learning long-term dynamics \u2014 but this only works if the policy can act on that information. This suggests that policy capacity is equally critical and should be tuned in parallel.",
    "Deepening critic or actor to 128 units improved reward to 51.39, but both achieved identical results\u2014indicating that network depth is not the bottleneck; instead, learning dynamics (e.g., learning rate) are more critical for policy convergence in MountainCarContinuous.",
    "Deepening the actor and critic to 512 units (from 128) in root_0 achieved 51.39 reward mean, showing that network capacity is critical\u2014yet both 128 and 512 units gave identical performance, suggesting that deeper networks may not scale linearly and that other factors (e.g., learning rate, activation) may dominate. This implies that future improvements should focus on stabilizing training dynamics rather than simply increasing capacity.",
    "Deepening the critic to 512 units achieved 68.8956 reward mean, showing that network capacity is a key factor, but the gain from 128 to 512 units is not linear \u2014 suggesting that training stability and learning rate are equally or more important than raw capacity."
