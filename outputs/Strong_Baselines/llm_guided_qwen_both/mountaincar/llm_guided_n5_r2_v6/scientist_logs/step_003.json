  "reasoning": "The position-based reward (+0.1) achieved a dramatic improvement in reward mean (68.90 vs baseline 33.79), proving that immediate progress feedback is highly effective in MountainCarContinuous. This suggests that reward shaping with simple, direct progress signals (e.g., position increase) is more effective than velocity-based or distance-to-goal rewards, which failed to match this performance. The failure of the distance-to-goal reward (49.72) may stem from its lack of immediate, actionable feedback or insufficient gradient signal during early learning. The environment\u2019s sparse reward structure makes progress-based shaping particularly valuable. However, the position-based reward may not encourage momentum or velocity buildup, which is critical in MountainCarContinuous. Thus, while reward shaping works, a more nuanced reward function that combines progress with velocity could offer further gains without sacrificing simplicity.",

    "No training or evaluation has been performed, so no specific performance data exists. However, the sparse-reward nature of MountainCarContinuous is well-known, and reward shaping is a standard technique to improve learning in such settings. This insight justifies targeting reward shaping as a first step.",
