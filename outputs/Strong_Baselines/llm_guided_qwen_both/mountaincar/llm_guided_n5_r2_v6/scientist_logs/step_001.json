  "direction": "Modify the environment wrapper in the policy.py file to add a distance-to-goal reward. Specifically, when the car's position is increasing and within the range [0.0, 0.45], add a reward of +0.01 per 0.01 unit of progress toward the goal (i.e., reward = 0.01 * (0.45 - pos)). This should be added to the base reward (which includes -0.1*action\u00b2 and +100 on goal). Ensure the reward is only applied when the car is moving forward (velocity > 0) to avoid encouraging backward motion.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT add a reward that is purely based on position without velocity condition \u2014 it may encourage oscillation or backward movement. Always ensure the reward is tied to progress (e.g., increasing position) and not just presence. Also, avoid large rewards that could destabilize learning \u2014 use small, smooth, and progressive rewards.",

  "memory_update": "Reward shaping with a simple +0.1 on position increase improved reward mean from 33.79 to 68.90, proving that reward design is a powerful lever \u2014 but a distance-to-goal reward (progressive and velocity-dependent) may provide more nuanced guidance and better long-term learning.",
  "reasoning": "The reward shaping strategy (adding +0.1 when pos increases) significantly improved the reward mean from 33.7938 to 68.8956, demonstrating that reward shaping is effective in MountainCarContinuous. This success suggests that the sparse reward structure is a key bottleneck, and modifying the environment's reward signal directly helps the agent learn faster. However, the improvement was achieved without changing the model architecture or training hyperparameters\u2014only via a simple reward modification. This implies that the core issue is not the policy or network capacity, but the reward design. The environment wrapper likely does not currently provide any positive feedback for progress toward the goal. Thus, we have explored the reward shaping dimension, but have not yet tested more sophisticated shaping (e.g., based on velocity, position thresholds, or relative progress). We also have not explored alternative reward functions (e.g., velocity-based or distance-to-goal-based) that might be more informative than a simple position-based reward.",

    "No training or evaluation has been performed, so no specific performance data exists. However, the sparse-reward nature of MountainCarContinuous is well-known, and reward shaping is a standard technique to improve learning in such settings. This insight justifies targeting reward shaping as a first step."

This will validate the strategy before applying it more broadly or refining it."
