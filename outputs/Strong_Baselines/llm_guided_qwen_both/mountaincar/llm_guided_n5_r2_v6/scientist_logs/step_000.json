This should be implemented in the environment\u2019s step function or in the policy\u2019s reward computation. Ensure the original +100 goal reward is preserved.",

  "memory_update": "No training or evaluation has been performed, so no specific performance data exists. However, the sparse-reward nature of MountainCarContinuous is well-known, and reward shaping is a standard technique to improve learning in such settings. This insight justifies targeting reward shaping as a first step.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is known, but no training or evaluation has occurred. Therefore, no diagnostic insights can be drawn. The solution space is entirely unexplored, and no prior attempts have been made to tune hyperparameters, modify network architecture, or adjust policy training dynamics. This is a clean starting point where we can explore novel strategies without relying on failed prior attempts.",
