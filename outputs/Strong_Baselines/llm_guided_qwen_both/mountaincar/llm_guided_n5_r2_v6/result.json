    "No training or evaluation has been performed, so no specific performance data exists. However, the sparse-reward nature of MountainCarContinuous is well-known, and reward shaping is a standard technique to improve learning in such settings. This insight justifies targeting reward shaping as a first step.",
    "Reward shaping with a simple +0.1 on position increase improved reward mean from 33.79 to 68.90, proving that reward design is a powerful lever \u2014 but a distance-to-goal reward (progressive and velocity-dependent) may provide more nuanced guidance and better long-term learning.",
    "Simple position-based reward (+0.1) achieved 68.90 reward mean, proving that immediate progress feedback is highly effective; adding velocity-based reward could further improve performance by encouraging momentum, which is essential in MountainCarContinuous.",
    "Position-based reward (+0.1) achieved 68.90 reward mean, proving progress feedback is highly effective; adding velocity-based reward (+0.05) could encourage momentum, which is critical in MountainCarContinuous, and may further improve performance without introducing complexity.",
    "Position-based reward (+0.1) achieved 68.90 reward mean, proving that immediate progress feedback is highly effective; adding a distance-to-goal reward (progressive and goal-oriented) may further improve performance by guiding the agent toward the goal without over-rewarding, offering a more structured and stable reward signal."
