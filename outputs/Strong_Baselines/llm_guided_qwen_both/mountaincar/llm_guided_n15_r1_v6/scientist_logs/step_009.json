  "reasoning": "The model capacity increase (hidden units from 256 to 512) achieved a significant improvement in reward mean (from 33.79 to 68.90), demonstrating that expressive policy networks are critical for learning the physical dynamics of MountainCar. This outperforms reward shaping (position/velocity increases), which only achieved ~49.72, suggesting that reward design is less impactful than model capacity in this sparse-reward setting. The failure of velocity-based reward shaping likely stems from its discontinuous and non-physical nature\u2014small velocity gains are not sufficient to guide learning. Training dynamics (learning rate, batch size) were explored but showed diminishing returns when scaled independently. Thus, model capacity is the dominant factor, and further gains may require architectural refinements (e.g., deeper layers, residual connections) or more sophisticated dynamics modeling.",
