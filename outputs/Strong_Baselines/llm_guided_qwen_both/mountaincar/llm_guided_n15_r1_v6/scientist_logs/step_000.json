This should be done in the rollout step of the policy, before the final reward is computed. Ensure the original +100 goal reward and -0.1*action\u00b2 penalty are preserved.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT alter the original environment's reward function directly \u2014 instead, modify the reward computation within the policy's rollout loop. Ensure the new reward is additive and not multiplicative. Test with a small value (0.1) to avoid destabilizing training.",

  "memory_update": "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the environment's default dynamics are insufficient to drive strong policy learning without reward shaping or improved training dynamics. Reward shaping is a low-cost, high-impact intervention that can guide the agent toward goal progress, which is critical in sparse-reward tasks like MountainCar.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is known, but no training or evaluation has occurred. Therefore, no diagnostic insights can be drawn from prior attempts. The solution space is entirely unexplored, and no promising branches exist to deepen. Given that we have 15 nodes remaining and no prior attempts, it is safe and efficient to begin with a novel, high-impact exploration rather than refining an existing path.",
