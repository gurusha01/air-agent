Specifically, in the actor's dense layers, after each hidden layer, add a residual connection: `x_a = x_a + nn.relu(nn.Dense(...)(x_a))`. Ensure the for-loop body is properly indented with 4 spaces and no extra newlines. Verify syntax with `python -c \"import src.networks; src.networks.get_model_ready(jax.random.PRNGKey(0), {'network_config': {'num_hidden_units': 512, 'num_hidden_layers': 4}})\"` before training.",

This success demonstrates that architectural expressivity drives performance in sparse-reward tasks. In contrast, attempts to add residual connections in the actor or critic networks (root_6 and root_6_0) failed due to syntactic errors\u2014specifically, indentation issues in the for-loop body\u2014proving that even small structural changes require strict code formatting. The failures were not due to conceptual flaws but to implementation precision. No reward shaping or training dynamics changes (e.g., velocity rewards, clipping) have been tested beyond baseline. The unexplored dimension is **policy stability via improved gradient flow**\u2014specifically, using residual connections in a syntactically correct, well-formatted manner to enhance learning without breaking the model.",

This will clarify whether architectural improvements like residual connections are viable with proper implementation, or if model capacity (hidden units) is the dominant factor. Understanding the failure mode in residual connection attempts will guide safe, syntactically correct modifications in future steps."
