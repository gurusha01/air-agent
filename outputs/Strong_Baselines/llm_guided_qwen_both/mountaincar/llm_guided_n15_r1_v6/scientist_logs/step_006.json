  "reasoning": "Reward shaping via position increase (root_1_0) achieved 49.72 reward mean, proving that incremental progress signals are effective and stable. This confirms that reward shaping should focus on goal-directed progress, not just final position. However, velocity-based rewards failed to improve performance, suggesting that reward design must be physically grounded and smooth. In contrast, increasing model capacity (root_2_0) initially improved performance (68.90 reward mean) but then degraded to 17.08 when hidden units were increased to 1024 \u2014 indicating that over-parameterization leads to instability or poor generalization. This suggests that model capacity has a non-linear, optimal range, and that hyperparameter tuning must balance expressivity with stability. The failure of the larger model implies that training dynamics (e.g., learning rate, batch size) may be more critical than raw capacity. Thus, we have explored reward shaping and model capacity, but not learning dynamics or policy smoothing.",
