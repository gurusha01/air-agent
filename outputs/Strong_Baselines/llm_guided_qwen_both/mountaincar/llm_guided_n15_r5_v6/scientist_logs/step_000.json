  "direction": "Modify the reward function in the environment wrapper to add a bonus of 0.1 when the car position exceeds 0.3, encouraging early progress toward the goal. This should be implemented in the environment's step function or via a custom reward function in the policy training loop. Ensure the bonus is additive and does not interfere with the original reward (e.g., -0.1*action^2 + 100 at goal + 0.1 when pos > 0.3).",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT modify the original reward function in the gymnas environment directly \u2014 instead, wrap the environment and apply the bonus in the step function. Ensure the bonus is only added when pos > 0.3 and not at the goal (to avoid reward hacking).",
  "mode": "explore",
  "memory_update": "Baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests poor performance without reward shaping; introducing a small bonus for progress toward the goal is a principled intervention that may break the \"reward cliff\" problem in MountainCar. This insight suggests that reward engineering is a critical first step before tuning policy architecture or hyperparameters.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is known, but no training or evaluation has occurred. This means we have no evidence to guide diagnosis. The environment MountainCarContinuous-v0 is a classic continuous control task with a high barrier to success due to the need for long-term planning and smooth action policies. Standard PPO may struggle without proper action scaling or reward shaping. No hyperparameter tuning or architectural changes have been attempted, so the solution space is entirely unexplored.",
