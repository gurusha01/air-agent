  "memory_update": "A fixed position bonus (+0.1 at >0.3) reduced reward mean from 33.79 to 32.96, indicating that reward shaping must be carefully designed\u2014simple, static bonuses can disrupt learning. This suggests that dynamic or state-dependent rewards (like velocity) are more effective.",
  "reasoning": "The reward shaping attempt (root_0) introduced a +0.1 bonus when position > 0.3, but it degraded performance (32.96 vs baseline 33.79), indicating that the reward function may be interfering with the natural dynamics or creating unintended incentives (e.g., reward hacking, premature goal-seeking). This suggests that reward shaping must be carefully designed\u2014simple bonuses may not align with the agent\u2019s learning of physical dynamics. The baseline score remains strong, implying that the default environment reward structure is already effective for the PPO agent. Thus, the issue is not with the policy architecture or training loop, but with reward engineering. We have not explored alternative reward shaping strategies (e.g., progressive, state-dependent, or action-dependent bonuses) or intrinsic motivation signals. Also, no hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size, or network depth) has been attempted.",

    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests poor performance without reward shaping; introducing a small bonus for progress toward the goal is a principled intervention that may break the \"reward cliff\" problem in MountainCar. This insight suggests that reward engineering is a critical first step before tuning policy architecture or hyperparameters."

This will guide whether reward shaping should be redesigned or avoided."
