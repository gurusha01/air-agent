    "No training has been run, so no scores or failures have occurred. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests that the default policy performs poorly, indicating that a learned value function is needed to guide policy updates effectively in a sparse-reward environment.",
    "Reducing value function units from 256 to 128 improved reward to 51.3875, suggesting that over-parameterization may introduce noise; adding entropy regularization could further improve exploration in sparse-reward environments.",
    "Reducing value units from 256 to 128 and adding entropy regularization both achieved 51.3875 reward, indicating that value function capacity and exploration regularization are not the primary bottlenecks \u2014 instead, the policy's ability to explore the action space effectively in sparse environments is underdeveloped.",
    "Reducing value units from 256 to 128 improved reward to 51.3875, but adding entropy or noise did not yield further gains \u2014 this suggests that value function stability and architecture matter more than exploration noise in sparse environments.",
