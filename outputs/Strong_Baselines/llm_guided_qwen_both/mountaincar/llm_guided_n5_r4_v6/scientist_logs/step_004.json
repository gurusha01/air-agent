  "reasoning": "The root_0 branch (score: 51.3875) successfully improved reward by reducing the value network's hidden units from 256 to 128, indicating that over-parameterization introduces noise and hinders learning in sparse-reward environments. This suggests the value function should be simpler and more stable. In contrast, root_1 failed catastrophically (score: -22.44), likely due to an incorrect or unstable architecture change (e.g., reducing layers or units too aggressively), possibly destabilizing the critic or policy. The failure highlights that architectural changes must be grounded in stability and empirical validation.  \n\nNo exploration of entropy regularization, action noise, or value-function sharing has been attempted. The policy\u2019s ability to explore the action space effectively remains underdeveloped, despite the value function being simplified. A promising unexplored dimension is introducing entropy regularization in the PPO loss to encourage exploration in sparse-reward settings \u2014 a known effective technique in continuous control.",
