  "memory_update": "No training has been run, so no scores or failures have occurred. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests that the default policy performs poorly, indicating that a learned value function is needed to guide policy updates effectively in a sparse-reward environment.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is observed without any model, indicating that the environment's default behavior (likely random or greedy) yields a low reward. Since the MountainCarContinuous-v0 is a challenging environment requiring learning to reach the goal (pos >= 0.45), the agent must learn a policy that balances action cost (penalty -0.1*action\u00b2) with progress toward the goal. The current setup lacks any learned policy, so no training has occurred. No hyperparameters or architectural choices have been tested. Thus, the solution space is entirely unexplored.",
