  "reasoning": "The modification of the value function hidden layer from 256 to 128 units led to a significant improvement in reward (from 33.7938 to 51.3875), suggesting that a smaller, more efficient value network may be better suited for the sparse-reward MountainCar environment. This implies that over-parameterization in the value function may introduce instability or noise in policy updates, while a more compact network improves convergence. However, the reward still has high variance (Std ~42), indicating that policy stability or exploration may be suboptimal. No failures occurred, and the training process completed successfully.  \n\nThe dimension of value function architecture has been explored, but hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, or value function layer depth (e.g., 64, 256) remain untested. Additionally, the policy network's architecture (e.g., activation functions, layer count) and the use of value function regularization or entropy bonus have not been evaluated.",
