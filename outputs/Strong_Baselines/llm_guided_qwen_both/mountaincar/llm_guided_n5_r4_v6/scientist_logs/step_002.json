  "reasoning": "The baseline reward of 33.7938 is poor, indicating that the default policy lacks effective value function guidance. Both root_0 and root_0_0 achieved a reward mean of 51.3875, suggesting that increasing the hidden layer size from 256 to 128 (root_0) and adding entropy regularization (root_0_0) are effective but do not yield further gains. This implies that the value function architecture is already optimized for this sparse-reward environment, and entropy regularization provides marginal benefit. The lack of improvement suggests that the current policy network may be under-parameterized for the task, or that the exploration mechanism is insufficient. The environment has a very sparse reward (only +100 on goal), so the policy must learn to navigate the valley efficiently. Thus, the value function and entropy regularization are not the limiting factors \u2014 instead, the policy might benefit from better action discretization or a more robust exploration strategy.",
