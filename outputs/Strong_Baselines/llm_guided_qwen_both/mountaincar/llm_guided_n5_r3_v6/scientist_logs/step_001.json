  "reasoning": "The reward shaping attempt (root_0) failed due to a fundamental misalignment: the environment wrapper modifies `gymnax.make`, but the code in `helpers.py` fails to properly import or define `gymnax`. The error \"name 'gymnax' is not defined\" persists even after multiple attempts to patch imports, indicating that the reward function was never correctly injected into the environment. The core issue is not the reward design itself, but the incorrect or incomplete environment override. This suggests that reward shaping via direct `make_env` override is fragile and incompatible with the current environment setup. No training or evaluation occurred due to this failure.  \n\nThe current solution space has not explored:  \n- Proper integration of reward shaping within the environment lifecycle  \n- Alternative policy improvements (e.g., better action scaling, learning rate tuning)  \n- Critically, the baseline policy may be too conservative; we haven\u2019t tested hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size, PPO epochs) to improve convergence.",
