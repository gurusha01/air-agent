  "direction": "Modify the reward function in the environment wrapper to add a small positive reward (e.g., +0.1) whenever the car position exceeds 0.25 (midway to the goal). This encourages early progress toward the goal without distorting the final reward. Ensure the original +100 goal reward is preserved. Update the `reward_fn` in `src/helpers.py` or the environment configuration in `src/config.yaml` to include this shaping.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT modify the final goal reward (+100) or remove the -0.1*action^2 cost. The reward shaping should only encourage progress. Ensure the new reward is added conditionally and does not create a bias toward actions that don't lead to the goal.",

  "memory_update": "No training has been run, so no performance scores or failures have been observed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests that the default policy is stable but suboptimal, indicating that reward shaping or improved policy learning is needed to break through the performance ceiling.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is achieved without any model, indicating that the environment's default policy performs reasonably but suboptimally. Since no training has occurred, no hyperparameters or architectural choices have been tested. The problem space is unexplored, and we lack any evidence to guide refinement. Therefore, we must begin with a foundational change that improves the agent's ability to learn in MountainCarContinuous-v0 \u2014 a continuous control task with sparse rewards.",
