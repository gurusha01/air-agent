  "direction": "Modify the reward scaling in src/config.yaml to increase the goal reward from 100 to 200 and reduce the action cost from -0.1 to -0.01. This will make reaching the goal more rewarding and reduce the penalty for action, encouraging the agent to explore and persist in the difficult phase.",
  "executor_guidance": "Ensure that the reward scaling is applied only to the environment\u2019s reward function, not to the loss or training loop. The action cost reduction should be small to avoid destabilizing training.",

  "memory_update": "Baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests poor exploration and weak goal motivation; reward shaping is a high-impact, low-complexity intervention that directly addresses the sparse reward problem in MountainCarContinuous.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is the default without any model, indicating that the environment is challenging and requires a well-tuned policy. Since no training has occurred, no failure modes or performance trends are evident. The problem space is unexplored, and we must begin with a foundational improvement to the policy or training setup.",
