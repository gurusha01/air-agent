  "direction": "Modify the reward function in the environment wrapper to add a small positive reward (e.g., 0.1) whenever the car's position exceeds 0.2. This encourages the agent to move toward the goal earlier, improving exploration and reducing the time to reach the goal. Ensure the reward is only added when the position is strictly increasing toward the goal (e.g., pos > 0.2 and pos > previous_pos).",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT modify the environment's default reward function directly \u2014 instead, wrap the environment in a custom wrapper that applies the reward shaping. Use `gymnax`'s `Env` interface to override the `reward` function. Ensure the shaping does not interfere with the goal reward (+100 at pos >= 0.45).",
  "mode": "explore",
  "memory_update": "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the default policy performs poorly, likely due to sparse rewards and lack of guidance toward the goal. Reward shaping is a proven technique in sparse-reward environments like MountainCar, suggesting that early progress in position should be incentivized.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is known, but no training or evaluation has occurred. Therefore, no diagnostic insights can be drawn from prior attempts. The solution space is entirely unexplored, and no promising branches exist to deepen. Given that we have 15 nodes remaining and no prior attempts, it is safe and effective to begin with a novel, high-impact exploration rather than refining an existing path.",
