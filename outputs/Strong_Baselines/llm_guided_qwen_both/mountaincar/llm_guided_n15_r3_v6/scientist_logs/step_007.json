  "reasoning": "The velocity reward shaping at 0.1 and 0.15 both achieved the same optimal reward mean of ~49.72, indicating that the reward shaping parameter is saturated \u2014 further increases do not improve performance. This confirms that movement-based incentives are critical and that the current reward function is already optimal in this configuration. No other hyperparameter changes (learning rate, action bounds, entropy coefficient) improved performance, and all attempts resulted in identical scores. The model architecture and training loop appear stable and effective. The only unexplored dimension is reward shaping beyond velocity \u2014 specifically, adding a position-based bonus in the valley (pos < 0.1) to encourage gradual ascent without over-rewarding movement. This would introduce context-aware reward shaping, potentially enabling smoother policy learning without sacrificing the benefit of velocity incentives.",
