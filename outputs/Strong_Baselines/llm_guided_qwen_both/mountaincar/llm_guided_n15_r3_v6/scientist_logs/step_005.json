    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the default policy performs poorly, likely due to sparse rewards and lack of guidance toward the goal. Reward shaping is a proven technique in sparse-reward environments like MountainCar, suggesting that early progress in position should be incentivized.",
