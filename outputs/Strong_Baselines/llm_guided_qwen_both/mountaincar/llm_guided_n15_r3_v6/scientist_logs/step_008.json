The policy and model architecture appear stable and well-tuned. No new dimension (e.g., position-based reward, entropy regularization, or value function improvements) has been explored. The current solution is optimal in terms of reward shaping, but we have not tested context-aware rewards (e.g., small positive reward in the valley for gradual ascent), which may encourage better policy learning without over-rewarding movement.",
