  "reasoning": "The velocity reward of 0.15 achieved a stable reward mean of 49.72, but the batch_size=512, update_freq=2, and warm-up configuration (warmup_steps=1000) pushed the reward mean to 56.04 \u2014 a significant improvement. This indicates that training stability via learning rate warm-up and efficient batch dynamics is critical in the MountainCar environment, where the policy must learn gradual, persistent actions in a flat reward landscape. However, both root_9 and root_9_1 achieved identical scores, suggesting that warm-up alone does not provide a performance gain beyond the baseline configuration. This implies that the reward shaping (velocity-based) is already optimal, and further gains may require changes in policy dynamics or exploration mechanisms. No exploration of entropy regularization, action noise, or curriculum learning has been attempted. The current solution is stable but likely not maximal.",
