  "reasoning": "The warm-up and batch size tuning (root_9) achieved a stable reward mean of 56.04, matching the score of root_9_1 with only warm-up enabled. This indicates that the learning rate warm-up is not the primary driver of performance\u2014batch size (512) and update frequency (2) appear to be more impactful for stability in this environment. However, the identical scores suggest that policy exploration mechanisms (e.g., entropy regularization, action noise, or curriculum learning) may be the key frontier for further improvement. Reward shaping (velocity reward) has already been optimized at 0.15, and adding position-based rewards failed. Thus, the unexplored dimension is policy exploration: encouraging diverse actions during early training to escape local optima in the flat valley region.",
