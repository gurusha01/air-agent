  "reasoning": "The reward shaping attempt (adding 0.1 reward when position increases) led to a worse performance (32.964 vs baseline 33.79), indicating that positive reward shaping for position progress may be counterproductive. This suggests the environment's sparse reward structure is not easily improved by simple reward hacking \u2014 early progress might be discouraged or misaligned with the true goal. The baseline (33.79) is already high, implying the default policy, though poor, may have a natural tendency to explore or drift toward the goal. This points to a deeper issue: the agent may lack sufficient guidance or learning capacity, not just reward design.  \n\nNo hyperparameter tuning (e.g., network depth) was explored beyond increasing hidden layers from 4 to 6 \u2014 which did not improve performance. This suggests that architectural changes alone are insufficient. Reward shaping failed, and no other strategies have been tested.",

    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the default policy performs poorly, likely due to sparse rewards and lack of guidance toward the goal. Reward shaping is a proven technique in sparse-reward environments like MountainCar, suggesting that early progress in position should be incentivized."

This will help determine if reward shaping is harmful or if the implementation had a flaw, such as incorrect timing or magnitude."
