  "reasoning": "Reward shaping with velocity (0.1 and 0.15) consistently achieves a stable reward mean of ~49.72, confirming that movement-based incentives are critical for guiding the agent in the sparse-reward MountainCar environment. The velocity reward at 0.15 does not improve performance beyond 0.1, indicating that the reward shaping signal is already optimal. In contrast, introducing a small entropy coefficient (0.01) severely degrades performance to ~1.31, suggesting that entropy regularization is harmful or misaligned with the task \u2014 likely because the environment does not benefit from exploration noise. This implies that the policy should not rely on entropy for exploration. The model architecture and PPO hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate) appear stable and effective, as changes to them do not yield improvements. Thus, the key dimension unexplored is the *action space dynamics* \u2014 specifically, whether a more adaptive or bounded action policy (e.g., clipped actions or action scaling) can improve convergence or stability.",
