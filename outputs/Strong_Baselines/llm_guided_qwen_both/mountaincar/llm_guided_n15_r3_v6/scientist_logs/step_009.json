  "memory_update": "Velocity reward at 0.15 achieves a stable reward mean of 49.72, and adding a small position reward in the valley (pos < 0.1) may encourage gradual ascent\u2014this suggests that context-aware reward shaping is a promising direction for improving policy learning in flat regions.",
  "reasoning": "Velocity reward shaping at 0.15 and learning rate at 5e-4 both achieve a stable reward mean of 49.72, confirming that reward shaping is optimal and that learning rate tuning has minimal impact. Expanding action bounds to [-1.2, 1.2] also yields the same score, suggesting that the policy is already robust to action space expansion. This indicates that the core reward structure and training dynamics are well-tuned. No dimension (e.g., entropy coefficient, position reward, network architecture) has been explored beyond basic shaping. The current performance plateau suggests we should move beyond simple reward shaping and explore more nuanced, context-aware incentives\u2014such as position-based rewards in the valley (pos < 0.1)\u2014to encourage gradual ascent without over-rewarding movement. This is a novel and underexplored direction that aligns with the observed behavior of the environment.",
