  "reasoning": "The reward shaping with velocity (enabled in root_1) achieved a significant improvement from baseline (33.79) to 49.72, indicating that velocity-based incentives are effective in guiding the agent toward meaningful movement in MountainCar. This suggests that the sparse reward structure is being addressed by encouraging velocity, which is a known effective technique in sparse-reward environments. However, the reward shaping was applied without specifying the exact velocity reward magnitude or its formulation. The success implies that a velocity-based reward (e.g., +0.1 per unit velocity) is beneficial, but the optimal value or form (e.g., clipped, normalized, or based on direction) remains unexplored. No other strategies have been tested, so we have not yet explored alternative shaping signals (e.g., position, momentum, or combined signals). The environment's dynamics are such that small, continuous rewards for velocity can encourage the agent to build momentum, which is critical in MountainCar.",

    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the default policy performs poorly, likely due to sparse rewards and lack of guidance toward the goal. Reward shaping is a proven technique in sparse-reward environments like MountainCar, suggesting that early progress in position should be incentivized.",
    "Reward shaping based on position (0.1 bonus) degraded performance from 33.79 to 32.96, indicating that early progress in position is not a reliable signal for success \u2014 instead, velocity-based incentives may be more effective in encouraging meaningful movement."
