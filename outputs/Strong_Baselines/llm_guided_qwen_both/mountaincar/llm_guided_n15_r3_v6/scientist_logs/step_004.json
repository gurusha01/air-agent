  "reasoning": "Reward shaping with velocity (0.1) achieved a score of 49.72, matching the score from increasing velocity reward to 0.15. This indicates that velocity-based reward shaping is highly effective and saturates at this level \u2014 no further improvement is seen by increasing velocity reward beyond 0.15. The baseline (33.79) is significantly lower, confirming that the environment is sparse and requires guidance. Position-based shaping degraded performance, suggesting it is not a reliable signal. Both nodes (root_1 and root_2) achieved identical scores, indicating that the reward shaping mechanism is robust and the agent is not sensitive to the exact velocity reward value within the tested range. This suggests that the current reward shaping is optimal, and further tuning in this dimension is unlikely to yield gains. However, no exploration has been done beyond reward shaping \u2014 other techniques such as action smoothing, entropy regularization, or experience replay have not been tested.",

    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the default policy performs poorly, likely due to sparse rewards and lack of guidance toward the goal. Reward shaping is a proven technique in sparse-reward environments like MountainCar, suggesting that early progress in position should be incentivized.",
    "Reward shaping based on position (0.1 bonus) degraded performance from 33.79 to 32.96, indicating that early progress in position is not a reliable signal for success \u2014 instead, velocity-based incentives may be more effective in encouraging meaningful movement.",
    "Velocity reward shaping (0.1) improved reward mean from 33.79 to 49.72, showing that velocity-based incentives are critical for guiding the agent in sparse-reward environments \u2014 this insight confirms that early movement is rewarded, not just reaching the goal.",
    "Velocity reward of 0.1 increased reward mean to 49.72, proving that movement-based incentives are essential in sparse environments \u2014 this insight validates reward shaping as a key lever for success."
