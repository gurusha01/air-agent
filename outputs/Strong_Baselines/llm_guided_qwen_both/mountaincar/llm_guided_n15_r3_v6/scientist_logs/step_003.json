Position-based shaping degraded performance, indicating that position progress alone is not a reliable signal. The policy and model architecture remain unchanged, suggesting that the improvement stems purely from reward design. No errors or instability were observed in training or evaluation. However, the velocity reward is fixed at 0.1 \u2014 we have not explored whether tuning its magnitude (e.g., 0.05, 0.15) or adding a position-based bonus (e.g., 0.01 for position > 0.1) could yield further gains. The current approach is effective but may not be optimal.",

    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 was observed with no model \u2014 this indicates that the default policy performs poorly, likely due to sparse rewards and lack of guidance toward the goal. Reward shaping is a proven technique in sparse-reward environments like MountainCar, suggesting that early progress in position should be incentivized.",
    "Reward shaping based on position (0.1 bonus) degraded performance from 33.79 to 32.96, indicating that early progress in position is not a reliable signal for success \u2014 instead, velocity-based incentives may be more effective in encouraging meaningful movement.",
    "Velocity reward shaping (0.1) improved reward mean from 33.79 to 49.72, showing that velocity-based incentives are critical for guiding the agent in sparse-reward environments \u2014 this insight confirms that early movement is rewarded, not just reaching the goal."

This will help validate the reward shaping strategy and ensure that the velocity reward is properly implemented and beneficial in the training process."
