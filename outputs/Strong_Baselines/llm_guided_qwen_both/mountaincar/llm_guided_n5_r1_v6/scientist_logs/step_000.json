This should be implemented in the environment configuration or via a custom reward function in the policy setup.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT modify the original reward function in the gymnas environment directly \u2014 instead, wrap the environment and override the reward function in the environment setup.

  "memory_update": "Baseline reward of 33.7938 with no model suggests poor default policy performance; introducing reward shaping addresses the sparse-reward problem and is a proven technique in continuous control tasks like MountainCar.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is achieved without any model, indicating that the environment's default policy performs reasonably but suboptimally. Since no training has occurred, no hyperparameters or model architectures have been tested. This means we have full freedom to explore novel strategies without risk of repeating failed paths. The problem is a continuous control task (MountainCarContinuous-v0) with a sparse reward, which makes it challenging for standard policies to learn long-term goals. Standard PPO may struggle due to the lack of reward shaping and the need for stable policy gradients in high-dimensional action spaces.",
