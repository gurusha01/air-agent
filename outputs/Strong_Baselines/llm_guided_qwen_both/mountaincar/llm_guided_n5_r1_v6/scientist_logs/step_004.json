  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT use fixed thresholds for position or velocity alone \u2014 they fail to capture momentum.

  "reasoning": "The reward shaping strategy in root_0_0 (position > 0.2 and velocity > 0.0 with +0.1) achieved a strong score of 54.43, demonstrating that momentum-based signals are effective in guiding the policy toward the goal. In contrast, root_1 (increasing hidden units to 512) achieved an even better score of 68.90, suggesting that model capacity (network depth) significantly improves performance in this sparse-reward environment. This indicates that both reward shaping and network architecture are critical dimensions. However, root_1's success likely stems from better policy learning capacity rather than reward signal design, and no further exploration of reward shaping with dynamic scaling (e.g., velocity-dependent shaping) was attempted. The failure of velocity-only shaping (root_0_0_0) suggests that isolated velocity rewards are insufficient. Thus, the most promising direction is not just deeper networks, but more sophisticated reward shaping that combines position and velocity in a physically meaningful way.",
