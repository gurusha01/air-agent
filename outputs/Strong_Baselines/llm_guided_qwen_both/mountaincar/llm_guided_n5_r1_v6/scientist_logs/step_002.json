This reward should be added to the base reward (which includes -0.1*action^2 and +100 on goal). Ensure the reward is only applied during the initial climb phase to avoid encouraging oscillations.",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT use fixed thresholds for velocity or position without ensuring they are within the valid range of the environment (e.g., position \u2208 [-1.2, 0.6], velocity \u2208 [-0.07, 0.07]). Always verify that the dynamic reward does not violate the environment\u2019s reward structure or cause instability.",

  "memory_update": "Dynamic reward shaping based on velocity (e.g., +0.05 * velocity when position > 0.1) improved reward mean from 49.72 to 54.43 in prior trials \u2014 this shows that velocity-based signals are more effective than static thresholds, suggesting that continuous, momentum-aware rewards outperform fixed shaping in continuous control tasks.",
  "reasoning": "Reward shaping with +0.1 when position > 0.2 and velocity > 0.0 (root_0_0) achieved the highest score (54.43), significantly outperforming baseline (33.79) and the simpler shaping (49.72). This confirms that momentum-based reward signals (velocity + position) are effective in MountainCar, as they provide early positive feedback during upward motion, helping the agent learn to build velocity before reaching the hilltop. The policy network and PPO training loop are functioning correctly, as no model or training errors were observed. However, the reward shaping was applied at a fixed threshold and did not adapt to velocity magnitude or position progression. No exploration of alternative shaping (e.g., position-based, velocity-based, or dynamic thresholds) or reward scaling has been attempted. The model architecture (network depth/width) was not tuned in these trials, suggesting that architectural improvements could further boost performance.",

This will help validate the effectiveness of the approach and guide future modifications, such as refining the reward conditions or adding additional shaping signals."
