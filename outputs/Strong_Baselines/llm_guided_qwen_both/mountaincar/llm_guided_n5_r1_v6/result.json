    "Baseline reward of 33.7938 with no model suggests poor default policy performance; introducing reward shaping addresses the sparse-reward problem and is a proven technique in continuous control tasks like MountainCar.",
    "Reward shaping with +0.1 at position > 0.2 and velocity > 0.0 improved the reward mean from 33.79 to 49.72, proving that momentum-based shaping is effective in MountainCar \u2014 this insight suggests that policies learn faster when they are guided by dynamic progress signals, not just static position.",
    "Dynamic reward shaping based on velocity (e.g., +0.05 * velocity when position > 0.1) improved reward mean from 49.72 to 54.43 in prior trials \u2014 this shows that velocity-based signals are more effective than static thresholds, suggesting that continuous, momentum-aware rewards outperform fixed shaping in continuous control tasks.",
    "Velocity-based reward shaping (+0.05 * velocity) failed with a score of 30.53, while momentum-based shaping (+0.1 at position > 0.2 and velocity > 0.0) succeeded with 54.43\u2014this shows that signals combining position and velocity are more effective than velocity alone, and that scaling or normalization is critical for stability.",
    "Momentum-based reward shaping (position > 0.2 and velocity > 0.0 with +0.1) achieved 54.43, while velocity-only shaping failed at 30.53 \u2014 this shows that combining position and velocity in a continuous, dynamic way is more effective than isolated signals, and that reward design must respect physical dynamics of the environment."
