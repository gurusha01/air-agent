  "direction": "Modify the reward function in the environment to add a small positive bonus (e.g., +0.1) when the car's velocity increases or when its position approaches the goal (pos >= 0.4). This should be implemented in the environment's reward function, not the policy. Ensure the bonus is only applied when the car is moving upward (velocity > 0) and near the goal region (pos >= 0.4).",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT add a static bonus for position alone \u2014 it caused catastrophic failure. The bonus must be tied to meaningful progress (velocity or movement toward goal). Ensure the bonus is small and conditional to avoid distorting the learning signal.",

  "memory_update": "A reward bonus of +0.1 for position alone failed with a score of -10402668544.0000, indicating that arbitrary reward shaping is unstable and misaligned \u2014 reward must be tied to meaningful progress (e.g., increasing velocity or approaching goal) to be effective.",
  "reasoning": "The only node attempted was a reward function modification adding +0.1 bonus when position exceeds 0.4, which resulted in a catastrophic score of -10402668544.0000 \u2014 orders of magnitude worse than baseline. This indicates that reward shaping with arbitrary positive bonuses is not only ineffective but likely introduces instability or misaligned incentives. The baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests the environment is inherently sparse and requires better policy dynamics or improved learning signals, not simple reward hacking. No valid training or evaluation attempts were made, so no performance trends or model behavior are observable. The failure implies that reward shaping must be carefully designed \u2014 likely tied to state features or action dynamics \u2014 not just position thresholds.",

    "No training has been run, so no performance data exists. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests that the default policy performs poorly, indicating a need for reward shaping or better policy dynamics in continuous control. This implies that sparse reward environments like MountainCar require structural changes to the reward signal to enable effective learning."
