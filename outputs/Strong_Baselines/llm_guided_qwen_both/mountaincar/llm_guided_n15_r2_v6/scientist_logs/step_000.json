  "direction": "Modify the reward function in the environment to add a small positive bonus (e.g., +0.1) whenever the car's position exceeds 0.3, encouraging early movement toward the goal. This should be implemented in the environment's step function or in the reward computation within the policy training loop. Ensure the bonus does not interfere with the original reward structure (e.g., -0.1*action^2 and +100 on goal).",
  "executor_guidance": "Do NOT alter the goal reward (+100 at pos >= 0.45) or the action cost (-0.1*action^2). The bonus should only be applied for positions > 0.3 to avoid distorting the learning signal. Keep the bonus small (e.g., 0.1) to prevent over-optimization.",

  "memory_update": "No training has been run, so no performance data exists. However, the baseline reward of 33.7938 suggests that the default policy performs poorly, indicating a need for reward shaping or better policy dynamics in continuous control. This implies that sparse reward environments like MountainCar require structural changes to the reward signal to enable effective learning.",
  "reasoning": "No nodes have been executed yet, so there is no data on what worked or failed. The baseline reward of 33.7938 is the default without any model, indicating that the environment is challenging and requires a well-tuned policy. Since no training has occurred, we cannot assess performance or identify failure modes. The current setup lacks any hyperparameter tuning, policy architecture changes, or learning rate adjustments that could improve convergence in MountainCarContinuous-v0, a continuous control task with sparse rewards.",
