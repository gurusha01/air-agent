  "strategy": "Introduce a learned state embedding layer using a small feedforward neural network to transform the raw state (position and velocity) into a high-dimensional latent space before feeding into the policy network. This embedding learns nonlinear patterns in the state space that better capture the dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment, enabling more effective policy parameterization and improving the agent's ability to generalize across difficult transitions. Use a fully connected policy network with a tanh output layer to map the embedded state to continuous actions, and train with PPO using a clipped objective. This approach shifts from raw state input to structured, learned representations, fundamentally changing the feature engineering strategy.",

  "reflection": "The physics-based state augmentation in **root_1** (score: 68.8956) has been the most successful approach to date, as it directly leverages the underlying dynamics of the Mountain Car problem by incorporating velocity and acceleration\u2014features that are inherently missing in the original state space. This improvement demonstrates that modeling physical derivatives significantly enhances the agent\u2019s ability to learn stable and efficient policies, especially in environments with sparse rewards and long-term dependencies. In contrast, **root_2** (score: -179.3586) catastrophically failed, indicating that hierarchical RL with arbitrary mode selection (e.g., \"accelerate,\" \"coast\") is not only ineffective but may introduce instability due to poor mode transitions or misaligned subgoals. Discretizing actions in **root_0** (score: 49.7180) yields a modest improvement over the baseline but fails to scale well, and while **root_0_0** (SAC with Gaussian policy) maintains the same score, it does not surpass the physics-augmented baseline, suggesting that continuous action policies alone are insufficient without better state representation. The next experiment should specifically expand **root_0** by introducing **velocity and acceleration features** into the state space *while* using a **SAC framework with a Gaussian policy**, and tuning the learning rate to 0.001 and batch size to 128, to test whether combining physics-based state augmentation with a more robust continuous policy (SAC) c..."
