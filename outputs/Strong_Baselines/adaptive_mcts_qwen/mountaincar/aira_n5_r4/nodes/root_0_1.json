Specifically, use a 128-dimensional LSTM layer followed by a feedforward head with 64-64 units and tanh activation. This allows the policy to learn long-term dynamics of the car's motion, such as the delayed effect of small pushes over time. Apply action noise via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise with a higher noise scale (0.5) to encourage exploration during early episodes, and reduce it gradually during later training phases. Train with a learning rate of 3e-4, and use a separate critic that computes a discounted future reward over a 5-step horizon to improve reward estimation.",

  "reflection": "The Chebyshev polynomial expansion combined with a feedforward neural network in **root_1** achieved the best score of **51.3875**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938), indicating that state-space discretization via polynomial transformation effectively captures the non-linear dynamics of MountainCarContinuous. This success stems from the Chebyshev basis\u2019s ability to efficiently represent and smooth continuous state variables over bounded domains, reducing approximation error in the policy. In contrast, **root_2** (GP-based state representation) failed with a score of **-16.3839**, suggesting that modeling uncertainty via Gaussian Processes is ill-suited for this deterministic, low-dimensional environment where noise and uncertainty are not meaningful or exploitable. The CNN in **root_0_0** also yielded only **10.1236**, likely due to misalignment with the problem\u2019s structure\u2014CNNs are designed for spatial data, not continuous state vectors with no inherent spatial locality. The TD3 variant in **root_0** (also 10.1236) underperformed, indicating that the baseline actor-critic may not be optimal for this task without better state representation. Therefore, the next experiment should specifically try a **Chebyshev polynomial expansion with a TD3 actor-critic architecture**, using the same state transformation as root_1 but replacing the feedforward network with a TD3 policy and critic, to leverage the proven state representation while benefiting from TD3\u2019s stabili..."
