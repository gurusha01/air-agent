Apply a CNN with 32-64-32 filters and ReLU activation to extract spatial patterns from the state space, followed by a fully connected layer to output actions. Introduce a dynamic reward shaping function that adds a small positive bonus when the car is near the top hill, encouraging faster trajectory learning. Use a reward scaling of 0.05 to further stabilize training.",

  "reflection": "The Chebyshev polynomial expansion in **root_1** achieved the best score of **51.3875**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938), because it effectively mapped the bounded, non-linear MountainCarContinuous state space into a compact, smooth, and well-conditioned representation that enabled the neural network to learn stable policies. In contrast, **root_0** using TD3 with a feedforward neural network only achieved **10.1236**, which is far below the baseline, indicating that the default policy architecture and parameterization fail to capture the complex dynamics of the environment. The failure of **root_2** (GP-based uncertainty modeling) with a negative score of **-16.3839** suggests that modeling uncertainty via Gaussian Processes is not only ineffective but may introduce instability or overfitting in this deterministic, low-dimensional environment. Since TD3 lacks the state-space conditioning that enables effective learning in this domain, the next experiment should specifically try **applying Chebyshev polynomial expansion to the TD3 architecture**\u2014i.e., use the same state transformation as in root_1 but within a TD3 framework\u2014by replacing the raw position and velocity inputs with Chebyshev-expanded features, using a 5th-degree polynomial basis, and training with a small batch size (64) and learning rate of 3e-4. This hybrid approach combines the robustness of TD3 with the improved state representation, offering a high probability of surpassing the current bes..."
