  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic thresholding mechanism to the latent representation during feature expansion. Instead of using a fixed neural network to compute the latent feature, modify the feedforward network to apply element-wise thresholding on its outputs (e.g., using ReLU with a learnable threshold parameter) only when the car's position is in the negative valley region (position &lt; -0.5). This encourages the latent representation to focus on more relevant patterns during the most challenging phase of the environment, improving generalization in the sparse reward region. The threshold values are learned during training via a small auxiliary loss that encourages stability in the latent space during transitions from the valley to the hill.",

  "reflection": "The state augmentation strategy in **root_0** (score: 68.8956) has proven most effective, outperforming both physics-based (root_2: 51.3875) and discrete action approaches (root_1: 49.7180), because it leverages a learned latent representation\u2014specifically a small feedforward neural network\u2014trained on position and velocity to capture non-linear, hidden dynamics that standard physics features miss. This dynamic feature expansion allows the agent to better generalize across the Mountain Car\u2019s steep, non-convex reward landscape. In contrast, the physics-based representation (root_2) fails to capture the nuanced state transitions, as energy-based features are linear and insufficient for the task\u2019s complex dynamics. Discretizing actions (root_1) is especially detrimental, as it limits exploration and fails to exploit the continuous nature of the problem, resulting in a 10-point drop in reward. The next experiment should extend root_0 by introducing a **time-variant latent feature expansion**, where the feedforward network is updated with a small learning rate (e.g., 1e-4) using a rolling window of past states and actions, to model temporal dependencies in the latent space. This would test whether dynamic adaptation of the latent representation\u2014rather than a static one\u2014further improves reward convergence, potentially pushing beyond 68.8956."
