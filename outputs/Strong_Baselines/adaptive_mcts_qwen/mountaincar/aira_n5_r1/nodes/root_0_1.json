This reduces noise in the latent feature updates, allowing for more stable and consistent feature learning in the sparse reward environment, which in turn leads to smoother policy gradients and better generalization in the MountainCarContinuous task. The reduced learning rate helps prevent overfitting to transient trajectories while still capturing long-term state patterns through the latent space.",

This success suggests that neural network-derived latent representations, even simple feedforward nets, can effectively encode complex state relationships beyond raw physics. In contrast, discrete action space policies (root_1: 49.7180) and physics-based energy features (root_2: 51.3875) underperform, likely because they fail to capture the continuous, non-linear nature of the control problem and lack the flexibility of continuous action spaces. The failure of root_0_0 (\u2212396.4103) with dynamic thresholding highlights that introducing instability or non-monotonic thresholds in latent features can catastrophically degrade performance, possibly due to poor gradient flow or ill-defined feature boundaries. The next experiment should specifically explore a **learned latent representation with a stable, normalized output (e.g., using a 2-layer MLP with ReLU and batch normalization)**, trained on a small dataset of state-action pairs, and combined with position and velocity\u2014without dynamic thresholds\u2014while using a fixed, stable scaling of the latent feature (e.g., scaled by 0.1 to 0.5) to maintain stability and avoid the col..."
