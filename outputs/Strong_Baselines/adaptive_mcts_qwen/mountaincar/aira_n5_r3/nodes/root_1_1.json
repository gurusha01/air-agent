  "strategy": "Modify the sinusoidal activation functions in the custom neural network to use a frequency-tuned sinusoidal basis, where the frequency of each sinusoidal component is learned during training via a small trainable parameter per feature (e.g., position, momentum, potential energy). This allows the network to adaptively capture the underlying oscillatory dynamics of the MountainCar environment, potentially improving the representation of energy transitions during the uphill phase. The frequency parameters are initialized uniformly and updated using gradient descent during the PPO training loop, with a separate learning rate for these parameters (e.g., 1e-4). This variation maintains the physics-based encoding but adds a learnable dynamical structure to the feature space, enhancing the agent\u2019s ability to recognize critical energy thresholds.",

  "reflection": "The physics-based state encoding in **root_1** (score: 68.8956) has been the most successful approach, outperforming baseline (33.7938) by over 100%, because it leverages intrinsic physical quantities\u2014momentum, potential, and kinetic energy\u2014that better capture the underlying dynamics of the Mountain Car problem. This transformation aligns the state space with the system\u2019s natural invariants, enabling the policy to learn more stable and physically meaningful control strategies. In contrast, **root_2** (51.3875) using a PINN with residual networks, while theoretically sound, fails to achieve the same performance, likely due to overfitting or poor dynamics modeling in a continuous control setting. **root_1_0** (\u221227513.8203) catastrophically fails, indicating that learned dynamic normalization without proper constraints or initialization leads to instability\u2014this approach should be avoided. **root_0** (FAIL) with TD3 shows that switching agents alone does not compensate for poor state representation, confirming that agent choice is secondary to state encoding. The next experiment should expand **root_1** by introducing a **learned physics-informed feature transformation**\u2014specifically, a neural network that learns to map position and velocity into momentum, energy, and a derived \"action potential\" feature, using a **2-layer MLP with ReLU activation and batch normalization**, trained on a physics-consistent loss (e.g., energy conservation error) to ensure stability and generalizat..."
