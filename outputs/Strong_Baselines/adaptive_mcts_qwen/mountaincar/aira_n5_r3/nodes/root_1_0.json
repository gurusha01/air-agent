This layer adapts to the specific dynamics of the episode, improving the stability of the policy gradients by reducing input variance. The normalization is applied before the sinusoidal activation block, ensuring that the energy features (momentum, potential, kinetic) are computed on a more consistent scale, which can enhance convergence speed and reward consistency.",

This approach aligns with the underlying dynamics of Mountain Car, where energy conservation and momentum play critical roles in policy learning, enabling the agent to better understand and exploit the environment\u2019s structure. In contrast, **root_2** (51.3875) using a PINN with a residual network failed to achieve comparable performance, likely due to overfitting to dynamics constraints rather than learning effective control policies. **root_0** (FAIL) highlights that TD3, despite being theoretically robust for continuous control, failed when applied with a standard fully connected network (256-hidden units), suggesting that architectural or hyperparameter choices (e.g., feature representation, learning rate, replay buffer size) were suboptimal. The next experiment should expand **root_1** by introducing a **physics-informed neural network (PINN) layer** within the policy network\u2014specifically, a residual block that enforces energy conservation constraints during training\u2014using the same momentum, potential, and kinetic energy features. This hybrid approach combines the interpretability of physics-based features with the adaptive learning of a PINN, potentially pushing the reward mean beyond 68.8956. Hyperparameters t..."
