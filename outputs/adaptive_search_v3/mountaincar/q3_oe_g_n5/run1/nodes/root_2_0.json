  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based trajectory encoder with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes a spatially structured representation of the state history. Instead of treating time steps as a sequence, reshape the past 100 time steps of position and velocity into a 2D grid (e.g., 10x10), where each cell represents a time step's state. The CNN learns spatial patterns in the state evolution, such as regions of slow movement or momentum buildup, which may capture long-term dynamics more efficiently than sequential models. This approach leverages spatial invariance and local feature detection, fundamentally different from both feedforward and LSTM-based encoders.",
