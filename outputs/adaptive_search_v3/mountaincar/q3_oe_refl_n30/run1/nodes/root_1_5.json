The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a multi-scaled state representation** (root_1), achieving a score of **37.4810**, which is 3.69 points above the baseline (33.7938). This success likely stems from the combination of TD3\u2019s robustness in continuous control and the multi-scaled state representation\u2014specifically, the inclusion of both original observations and normalized position/velocity\u2014which improves the agent\u2019s sensitivity to the environment\u2019s dynamics.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **hierarchical structures** (root_1_2, root_0, root_1_4) or **complex hybrid models** (root_1_1, root_1_2_0) have either failed or produced extremely poor scores (e.g., root_1_4: -254.8266, root_0: -3.2e12), indicating that hierarchical planning or GMM-based clustering may introduce instability or overcomplication without clear benefit. Similarly, **physics-informed models** (root_2) have catastrophically failed, suggesting that PINNs or residual dynamics models are not suitable for this environment due to poor generalization or training instability.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **expand root_1_3_0_0**\u2014the CNN-based continuous state embedding\u2014by introducing **a residual connection in the CNN encoder** and **adding a dynamic scaling layer** that adapts the input range of position and velocity based on the current state (e.g., using a learned scale factor per episode). This builds on the success of the multi-scaled representation while leveraging the CNN\u2019s ability to capture spa..."
