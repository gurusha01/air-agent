  "strategy": "Replace the hierarchical state representation with a dynamic graph-based state encoding that models the MountainCar system as a graph where nodes represent discrete energy levels and edges encode transition probabilities based on velocity and position. Use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn state representations by aggregating local neighborhood information, allowing the agent to reason about potential energy landscapes as a relational structure rather than a latent feature. Introduce a curriculum learning component where the agent starts in low-energy regions and gradually transitions to higher-energy ones, improving long-term planning. Combine this with a novel entropy bonus that scales with the distance from energy minima to promote exploration toward optimal basins.",

The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a multi-scaled state representation** (root_1), achieving a score of **37.4810**, which is 3.69 points above the baseline (33.7938). This success likely stems from the combination of TD3\u2019s stability in continuous control and the multi-scaled state representation\u2014specifically, the inclusion of both original observations and normalized position/velocity\u2014which better captures the dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment.  \n\n2. Several approaches have consistently failed or should be avoided: the **hierarchical RL framework** (root_0, root_1_2, root_1_2_0) and **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** (root_2) resulted in catastrophic failures (scores as low as -111 trillion or -32 million), indicating that overcomplicating the state modeling or introducing non-robust dynamics models leads to instability. Similarly, **SAC with a shared encoder** (root_1_0) and **GMM-based clustering** (root_1_1) failed, suggesting that poor state representation design or mismatched algorithmic assumptions (e.g., discrete vs. continuous) cause divergence.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_5**, which achieved a score of **37.4270**\u2014just 0.054 points below the best result\u2014by refining its **hierarchical state representation**. Specifically, we should introduce a **learned latent state vector** that is jointly trained with a **SAC agent** using a **state encoder with residual connections** (e.g., a 2-layer MLP with batch n..."
