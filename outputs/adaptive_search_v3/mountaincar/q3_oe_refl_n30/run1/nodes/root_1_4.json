  "strategy": "Replace the TD3 agent with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, using a hierarchical state representation where position, velocity, and a learned latent feature derived from the gradient of the potential energy function are concatenated. Introduce a dynamic noise schedule that increases exploration intensity during early training and decays exponentially after the first 50 episodes. Use a shared actor-critic architecture with entropy regularization (target entropy set to -1.0) and a critic target update frequency of every 20 steps to maintain stability. Monitor entropy and mean reward simultaneously, and adjust the temperature parameter dynamically based on observed entropy values to balance exploration and exploitation.",

The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a multi-scaled state representation** (root_1), achieving a **reward mean of 37.4810**, which is 3.69 higher than the baseline (33.7938). This success likely stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise and its stability in continuous control tasks, combined with the multi-scaled state representation\u2014specifically, the inclusion of **normalized position and velocity**\u2014which improves the agent\u2019s sensitivity to the critical dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **hierarchical planning** (root_1_2) and **hybrid architectures with GMMs or transformers** (root_1_1, root_1_2_0) have either failed or yielded identical scores, suggesting that the added complexity of high-level goal selection or state clustering does not provide a meaningful advantage in this simple, low-dimensional environment. The **PINN-based dynamics model** (root_2) and **SAC with shared encoders** (root_1_0) also failed or produced catastrophic scores (e.g., -11 trillion), indicating that over-engineering or poor dynamics modeling leads to instability.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent by introducing dynamic state scaling**\u2014specifically, applying adaptive normalization (e.g., per-episode or per-trajectory statistics) to the position and velocity inputs\u2014while maintaining the multi-scaled state representation. This builds on the success of root_1 without adding complexity that has failed elsewhere, and directl..."
