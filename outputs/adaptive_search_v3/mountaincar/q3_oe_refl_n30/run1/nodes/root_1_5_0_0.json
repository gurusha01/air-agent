The PINN learns to approximate the true dynamics of the system using a neural network trained on the physics equations, and this learned dynamics model is used to guide the policy gradient updates. This ensures that the agent\u2019s actions remain physically plausible and reduces the risk of exploring infeasible trajectories, thereby improving convergence to high-reward policies.",

The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a multi-scaled state representation** (root_1), achieving a score of **37.4810**, which is 3.69 points above the baseline (33.7938). This success stems from combining the robustness of TD3\u2014known for stable policy learning in continuous control\u2014with a well-designed state representation that includes both original observations and normalized position/velocity, which improves signal clarity and prevents poor scaling in the state space.  \n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed include **hierarchical frameworks without stable low-level policies** (e.g., root_0, root_1_2, root_1_2_0), which either collapse into failure (e.g., root_0 with -3.2e10 score) or fail due to poor goal-conditioned planning. Similarly, **physics-informed models** (root_2) and **hybrid GMM-DDPG** (root_1_1) have failed due to overcomplication, poor dynamics modeling, or instability in policy updates. The **SAC with hierarchical state representation** (root_1_5) achieved only 37.4270\u2014slightly below TD3\u2014suggesting that hierarchical abstraction may not be effective without strong low-level policy grounding.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the dynamic graph-based state encoding in root_1_5_0** by explicitly incorporating **temporal dynamics**\u2014such as past velocity trends or acceleration history\u2014into the graph edges, using a **GNN with a 5-step temporal window** (e.g., position and velocity at t-1 to t-5) to model state transitions.
