Introduce a temperature parameter that dynamically adjusts based on episode progress to balance exploration and exploitation. Use a shared encoder for state representation and separate actor and critic networks with separate target updates. Apply adaptive learning rates that decay based on gradient variance to improve convergence. Perform a 500-step warm-up trajectory with random noise injection to initialize policy stability.",

This success suggests that deterministic policy gradients with noise injection, especially in continuous control tasks, outperform stochastic methods like SAC in this setting. In contrast, **root_0** (SAC) failed with a negative score of **-68.4830**, highlighting that SAC's reliance on entropy regularization and stochastic policies may lead to poor convergence or instability in this particular environment, possibly due to over-exploration or poor action distribution. The failure of SAC and the underperformance of the simpler TD3 variant with standard ReLU MLPs (root_2) suggest that hyperparameter tuning\u2014such as learning rate, noise scale, and target update frequency\u2014is essential. The next experiment should specifically expand **root_1** by introducing a **learned noise schedule** (e.g., gradually decreasing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise amplitude over training epochs) and testing a **critic network with a larger hidden layer (e.g., 256\u2013512 units)** to improve action-value estimation accuracy, while keeping the same TD3 structure and continuous action space.
