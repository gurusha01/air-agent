  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid neural network architecture combining a Transformer-based policy head with a discrete latent variable model for action representation. The Transformer processes the state sequence (position, velocity) over time to capture temporal dependencies in the MountainCar dynamics, while the discrete latent variable model enforces sparsity and encourages policy exploration by sampling from a learned latent space that aligns with physically meaningful control transitions (e.g., short bursts of acceleration). This structure improves long-term planning and reduces overfitting to local reward patterns, enabling more stable and physically grounded control policies.",
