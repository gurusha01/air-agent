  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic state encoding layer using a learned latent representation derived from a contrastive self-supervised pre-training objective on simulated MountainCar trajectories. This layer maps raw state observations (position, velocity) into a higher-dimensional space where semantically meaningful patterns\u2014such as valley traversal depth or momentum direction\u2014are captured through inductive bias from unsupervised clustering and contrastive loss. The latent representation is then fed into the PPO policy network, enabling the agent to generalize better across phases of the task by focusing on invariant features rather than raw inputs. This approach replaces explicit behavior cloning with a representation-level prior, avoiding trajectory-based data synthesis while still improving generalization in low-reward regions.",
