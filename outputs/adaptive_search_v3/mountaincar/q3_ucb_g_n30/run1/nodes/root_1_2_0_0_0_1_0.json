  "strategy": "Replace the PPO policy network with a transformer-based actor-critic architecture that processes state trajectories as sequences, using self-attention to model long-term momentum dependencies. Introduce a temporal reward shaping component that assigns credit based on the predicted future position using a recurrent state estimator, enabling the agent to plan ahead and avoid energy waste during downhill phases. This approach shifts from static state-action modeling to dynamic temporal reasoning, improving planning in the energy-constrained environment.",
