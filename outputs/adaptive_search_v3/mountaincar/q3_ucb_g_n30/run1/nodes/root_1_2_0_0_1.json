This layer predicts the next state trajectory and is used as a regularization term during training\u2014only actions that result in plausible, physically consistent trajectories (e.g., no impossible velocity spikes or position jumps) are rewarded. This forces the agent to learn dynamics-aware policies, reducing trial-and-error in low-reward regions by grounding actions in physical plausibility.",
