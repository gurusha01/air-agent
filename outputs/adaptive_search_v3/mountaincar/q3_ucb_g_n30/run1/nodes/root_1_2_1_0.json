  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to model the underlying dynamics of MountainCarContinuous by jointly training a neural network on both the observed state transitions and the known physical equations of motion (e.g., F = ma, energy conservation). The PINN acts as a learned dynamics model that predicts next states from current states and actions, and this prediction is used to augment the state representation in both the actor and critic. This allows the agent to operate with a more accurate and physically grounded model of the environment, improving long-term planning and reducing reward drift. The PPO loss is further regularized with a term that penalizes deviations between predicted and actual transitions.",
