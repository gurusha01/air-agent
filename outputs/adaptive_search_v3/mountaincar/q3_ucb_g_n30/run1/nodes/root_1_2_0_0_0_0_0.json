  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic state encoding layer using Fourier features on the position and velocity states, transforming the continuous state space into a high-dimensional, periodic representation that captures oscillatory dynamics inherent in the MountainCar environment. This enables the PPO policy to better generalize across similar trajectories by exploiting the periodic nature of the physics, especially in the valley region. The Fourier features are learned via a small trainable projection layer and are applied before the policy network's input layer, enhancing sensitivity to phase-based patterns in the state.",
