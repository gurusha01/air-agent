  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-based reward shaping module that dynamically adjusts the reward signal during training by incorporating energy conservation principles. Specifically, compute a state-dependent energy function (E = 0.5 * m * v^2 + m * g * h) and penalize transitions that violate energy bounds (e.g., energy increase without corresponding action), thereby guiding the agent toward physically plausible trajectories. This shaping encourages stable policy learning by aligning the reward with the known energy dynamics of the system, reducing the need for extensive exploration in unsafe regions.",
