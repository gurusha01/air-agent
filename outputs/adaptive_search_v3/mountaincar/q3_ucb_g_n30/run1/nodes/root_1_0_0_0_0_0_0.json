  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-guided latent space representation using a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on trajectories that satisfy the MountainCar dynamics. The VAE encodes observed state trajectories into a latent space where each latent variable is constrained to follow a differential equation-based prior derived from Newtonian mechanics. During PPO training, the policy is conditioned on the latent representation, ensuring that only physically consistent state transitions are sampled. This approach replaces direct policy parameterization with a latent dynamics model, effectively filtering out non-physical actions during exploration.",
