  "strategy": "Variation: Introduce state-value normalization + slightly more aggressive entropy regularization.\n\n1. Keep the PPO algorithm/architecture exactly the same but:\n   \u2022 Add running mean/variance normalisation of the critic value targets (subtract mean, divide by std when computing the value-loss term).  \n   \u2022 Increase entropy-coefficient from 1e-3 to 3e-3 to encourage more exploration in the early phase; then linearly decay it to 0 over the last 30 % of training.  \n   \u2022 Keep other hyper-parameters unchanged.\n\nRationale: Value normalisation usually stabilises learning in continuous-control tasks with small reward ranges (MountainCarContinuous has tight rewards). The higher (but decaying) entropy bonus should help the policy escape the shallow local optima it often settles in before it starts climbing the hill.",
