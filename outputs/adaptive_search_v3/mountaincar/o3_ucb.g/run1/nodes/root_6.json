Start training with clip_range = 0.4 and entropy_coef = 0.02 for the first 40 % of total timesteps.\n2. Linearly decay clip_range to the standard 0.2 and entropy_coef to 0.0 over the remaining 60 % of timesteps.\n3. Keep learning-rate schedule, GAE (\u03bb = 0.95), batch-size, etc., exactly as in the baseline run.\n4. Everything else (network architecture, observation normalization, reward scaling) remains identical.\n\nRationale\n\u2022 A wider clip early on encourages faster exploration and larger policy updates, which is often useful in MountainCarContinuous where discovering the \u201cpush-then-swing-up\u201d strategy is hard.\n\u2022 As soon as the policy begins to improve, tightening the clip and removing the entropy bonus stabilises optimisation and avoids destroying a near-optimal solution.\n\u2022 Because nothing else is changed, this is a minimal, tractable tweak to the existing approach.",
