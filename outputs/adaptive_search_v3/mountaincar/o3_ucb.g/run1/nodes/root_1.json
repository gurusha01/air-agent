  "strategy": "Replace the default MLP actor-critic with a linear policy/value function built on top of a fixed Radial Basis Function (RBF) feature expansion of the 2-dimensional state.  \nSteps:  \n1. Pre-compute 100\u2013200 Gaussian RBFs whose centers are tiled over the (position, velocity) space; bandwidth \u03c3 chosen so neighbouring bases overlap ~30 %.  \n2. For every environment step, map the raw state to the RBF vector \u03c6(s) \u2208 \u211d\u00b9\u2070\u2070 and pass it through a single linear layer to output mean action \u03bc=\u03b8\u1d40\u03c6(s) (squashed by tanh) and value V(s)=w\u1d40\u03c6(s).  \n3. Train with PPO exactly as before (same clipping, GAE, etc.) but with much smaller learning rate (\u223c1e-3) and no entropy bonus (the basis already covers exploration).  \n4. Keep the feature map fixed; only linear weights are updated, giving a convex objective per PPO epoch and dramatically reducing variance.  \nRationale: MountainCarContinuous has a very low-dimensional, smooth value landscape; hand-crafted RBFs capture the important non-linearities while avoiding the over-parameterization and instability of deep nets, often boosting average return to the 90+ range within 50k steps.",
