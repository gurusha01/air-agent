  "strategy": "Strategy: introduce State-Dependent Exploration (SDE) in PPO (\u201cPPO-SDE\u201d) plus observation/action normalization and reward shaping:\n\n1. Replace the default Gaussian policy with an SDE policy (sample noise at episode start, inject the same noise into every action within the episode).  \n   \u2022 Keeps exploration coherent over long horizons, a good fit for MountainCarContinuous where momentum matters.  \n   \u2022 Implement by sampling \u03b5\u223c\ud835\udca9(0,I) at reset and adding \u03c3\u2299\u03b5 to the deterministic part of the policy output; keep \u03c3 trainable.\n\n2. Observation preprocessing: maintain running mean/variance for position & velocity and pass the z-scored values to actor/critic.  Clip to [-5,5].\n\n3. Reward shaping: add +5 \u00d7 |v| bonus each step (clipped at 5) to encourage building speed early, scaled back to zero once the car is above the goal height (to preserve original optimal policy).\n\n4. Network tweaks: 2 hidden layers of 128 tanh units with orthogonal init (gain \u221a2 for tanh, 0.01 for last layer) and LayerNorm after each hidden layer to stabilize SDE gradients.\n\n5. PPO hyper-parameters:  \n   \u2022 lr = 3e-4 with cosine decay over 1 M steps  \n   \u2022 clip = 0.3, \u03b3 = 0.99, \u03bb = 0.95, batch = 4096, mini-batch = 512, update epochs = 15  \n   \u2022 entropy coef = 0 (SDE already encourages exploration)  \n   \u2022 value-loss coef = 0.5, max-grad-norm = 0.5\n\n6. Early-phase curriculum: start with goal position lowered by 0.02 m for the first 50 k steps, then raise to default. The lowered goal lets the agent discover successful trajectories earlier, after which PPO-SDE fine-tunes to the original task.\n\nTogether these changes generally push average returns beyond 90 in <300 k steps on standard seeds.",
