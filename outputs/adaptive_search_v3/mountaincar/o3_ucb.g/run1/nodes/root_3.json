  "strategy": "Variation \u2013 Add Layer Normalization to the PPO policy/value networks and use a linear learning-rate decay.\n\nWhy it is a small, in-family tweak:\n\u2022 Network architecture is still MLP, optimiser is still Adam, clip/objective unchanged.  \n\u2022 LayerNorm after each hidden layer reduces activation scale drift, which is noticeable in MountainCarContinuous where the observation distribution shifts as the car climbs the hill.  \n\u2022 A linear schedule that decays the learning rate from 3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 to 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 over 1 M steps can keep early exploration aggressive while letting later updates converge more smoothly; this often lifts the asymptotic return a few extra points without extra hyper-tuning.  \n\nHyper-parameters to try:\n\u2022 Hidden sizes: 256-256 (same) with LayerNorm after each layer.  \n\u2022 clip_range = 0.2 (unchanged).  \n\u2022 gae_lambda = 0.95, \u03b3 = 0.99 (unchanged).  \n\u2022 lr_schedule: linear decay.  \n\u2022 entropy_coef: 0.0 \u2192 0.005 (grid search two values to maintain exploration once learning rate drops).  \n\nExpected benefit: slightly higher stability (fewer catastrophic policy collapses) and a modest increase in average return because later updates fine-tune rather than overshoot.",
