  "strategy": "Introduce a model-based reinforcement learning approach using a physics-informed neural dynamics model to predict the next state given the current state and action. This model is trained on a large dataset of simulated MountainCar trajectories, allowing the PPO agent to plan ahead and anticipate outcomes. The high-level planner uses this predictive model to select goals that are more likely to be achievable, reducing the chance of failure in the low-level policy. This approach shifts focus from reactive to proactive planning, enabling better long-term decision-making and improving convergence to high rewards.",
