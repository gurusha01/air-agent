  "strategy": "Replace the pixel-based observation with a hand-crafted state vector that explicitly encodes position, velocity, and a derived momentum term (velocity squared), and apply a linear neural network with adaptive learning rate scaling based on episode progress. This approach removes reliance on visual inputs entirely, using physics-informed feature engineering to directly model the dynamics of the MountainCar environment. Use a custom reward shaping function that penalizes oscillatory behavior and rewards sustained forward motion, which improves policy convergence in low-dimensional but high-dynamic environments.",
