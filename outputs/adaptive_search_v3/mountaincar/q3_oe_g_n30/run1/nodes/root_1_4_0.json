  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that models the underlying dynamics of the MountainCar system as a differential equation. The PINN acts as a prior to guide the policy network by predicting the next state given current position, velocity, and action, enabling more informed action selection. The PPO agent uses this predicted dynamics to adjust its action distribution based on a learned cost function that penalizes trajectories violating known physical constraints (e.g., acceleration limits). This provides a strong prior on feasible actions, improving exploration efficiency and convergence speed. The PINN is trained on simulated trajectories and then integrated into the PPO loss via a regularization term.",
