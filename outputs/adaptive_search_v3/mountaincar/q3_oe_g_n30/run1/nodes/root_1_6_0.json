  "strategy": "Introduce a curriculum learning schedule where the agent starts training on progressively easier variants of the MountainCar environment\u2014beginning with a small, slightly modified reward that encourages movement toward the goal in a stable, low-velocity regime, then gradually increasing the difficulty by introducing noise, asymmetric rewards, or reduced reward for intermediate milestones. This allows the policy to build stable baselines before facing the full complexity of the original task. Use dynamic curriculum progression based on the agent\u2019s performance on each level, adjusting the difficulty threshold when the mean reward exceeds a target (e.g., 40). This encourages robustness and generalization without overfitting to easy tasks.",
