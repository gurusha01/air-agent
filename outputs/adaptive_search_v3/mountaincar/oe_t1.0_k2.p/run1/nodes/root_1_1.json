  "strategy": "Introduce a hierarchical policy architecture where the policy is decomposed into two stages: a high-level planner that selects target positions on the mountain based on current state (position, velocity), and a low-level controller that generates continuous actions to reach those targets. This planner uses a simple neural network with a small latent space to predict optimal target heights, while the controller (a separate PPO agent) learns to execute trajectories toward these goals. This approach decouples goal selection from action execution, enabling more structured and goal-directed exploration, which is especially beneficial in the MountainCarContinuous environment where reaching the top requires long-term planning.",
