  "strategy": "Introduce a learned momentum feature that is not only derived from the previous action but also incorporates a smoothed version of the velocity (using a moving average over the last 3 time steps) to better capture dynamic momentum in the MountainCar environment. This refinement improves the state representation\u2019s ability to model physical inertia, which is crucial for long-term policy decisions in a low-energy environment. The momentum feature is scaled and normalized in the same way as position and velocity, and added as a separate input channel to the actor-critic network. The smoothing is applied using a simple exponential moving average with a decay factor of 0.95.",
