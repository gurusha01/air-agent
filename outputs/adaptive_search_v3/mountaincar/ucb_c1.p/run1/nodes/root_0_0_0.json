  "strategy": "Introduce a state-dependent reward shaping mechanism that adds a small, velocity-based bonus when the car's velocity exceeds 0.5, encouraging the agent to build momentum early in the episode. This reward shaping is applied only during the first 50% of the episode to prevent over-optimization and maintains the original reward structure otherwise. The bonus is scaled by a factor of 0.1 to avoid destabilizing training, and the policy is trained with a separate reward coefficient learned via a separate auxiliary loss during PPO updates.",
