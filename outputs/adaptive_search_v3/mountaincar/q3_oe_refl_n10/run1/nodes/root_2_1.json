  "strategy": "Introduce a learned state embedding layer that maps the continuous state space (position and velocity) into a latent 64-dimensional space using a neural network with ReLU activations. This embedding is then used as input to the policy network, enabling the agent to learn more abstract and discriminative representations of progress. The embedding is updated during training via gradient descent, allowing the model to discover meaningful intermediate features (e.g., velocity direction, momentum) that correlate with successful trajectory progression. This approach shifts representation learning from hand-crafted features to end-to-end discovery, enabling better generalization to unseen states in the MountainCarContinuous environment.",

The HRL framework (root_1) and its variants have achieved the best score of **49.7180**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938), indicating that goal-directed policy decomposition\u2014where high-level goals like \"reach hilltop\" or \"start moving up\" guide low-level actions\u2014is highly effective in Mountain Car. This success likely stems from better exploration of state-space structure and reduced policy complexity compared to flat policy networks.\n\n2. The TD3 experiment (root_0) failed (FAIL), suggesting that simply swapping PPO with TD3 without architectural or reward alignment is insufficient in this environment. This implies that algorithmic choice alone is not enough\u2014especially in continuous control tasks with sparse rewards\u2014where reward shaping and policy structure matter more than the baseline algorithm.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_2** with a **state-dependent reward shaping mechanism using a learned reward model** (like root_2_0_0), specifically training a small neural network to predict future returns from intermediate states (e.g., car position and velocity). This should use a **fully connected network with 128 hidden units**, trained on historical transitions, and apply the shaped reward only when the car is near the hilltop or in a \"low velocity\" state. This builds on the success of reward shaping in root_2_0_0 and directly addresses the sparse reward problem in Mountain Car."
