Introduce a learned velocity-based penalty that discourages oscillations and encourages upward momentum, using a sliding window of past states to estimate progress toward the hilltop. This approach avoids goal decomposition and instead focuses on continuous trajectory optimization via reward shaping that directly encourages velocity and position convergence.",

The hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework in **root_1** achieved the best score of **49.7180**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938), indicating that goal-directed policy decomposition\u2014where high-level policies select coarse objectives like \"reach hilltop\" or \"start moving up\"\u2014effectively improves exploration and long-term planning in the Mountain Car environment. This success suggests that structuring the problem into manageable subgoals enables the agent to learn stable, goal-conditioned behaviors without getting stuck in local optima.\n\n2. Approaches that replaced HRL with single actor-critic networks (e.g., **root_1_0**) or introduced reward shaping via learned models (e.g., **root_1_0_0**) failed to improve performance despite theoretical appeal\u2014likely due to poor state representation or overfitting in reward prediction. Similarly, **root_0** (TD3 replacement) failed outright, possibly because TD3's stability requirements were not met in this high-dimensional, sparse-reward setting without proper initialization or hyperparameter tuning.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1** by introducing a **goal-specific reward shaping mechanism** that provides a bonus when the car reaches intermediate milestones (e.g., position > -0.5 or velocity > 0.1), with the reward scaled by a learned function based on the current state and goal. Specifically, use a **small, state-dependent reward multiplier** (e.g., 1.5x) when transitioning from \"start mo..."
