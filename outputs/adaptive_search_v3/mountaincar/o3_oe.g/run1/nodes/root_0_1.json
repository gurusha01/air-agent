  "strategy": "Adopt an entropy-maximizing critic-based method instead of PPO: train a Soft Actor\u2013Critic (SAC) agent with twin Q-networks, automatic temperature tuning, and prioritized replay.  \n1. State preprocessing: normalize position/velocity to zero mean, unit variance online; append a sinusoidal time-to-go feature t/T to encourage early acceleration.  \n2. Replay buffer of 3e5 transitions; prioritize by |TD-error| with exponent 0.6, importance-sampling correction 0.4\u21921.0.  \n3. Actor outputs mean \u03bc(s) and log-std \u03c3(s) clipped to [-20,2]; reparameterize actions, then squash with tanh and rescale to env bounds, eliminating exploration noise scheduling.  \n4. Target networks updated with \u03c4=0.005.  \n5. Reward shaping: add +1.0\u00d7(abs(velocity)) to existing reward to guide uphill momentum, but subtract it at episode end when computing reported return so leaderboard metric is unaffected (potential-based shaping).  \n6. Learning rates: 3e-4 for Q/actor, batch size 512, update every 1 env step with 1 gradient step (more off-policy than PPO).  \nBecause SAC keeps high entropy until value confident, it explores more effectively than clipped-ratio PPO, and momentum-based shaping speeds discovery of the 0.09 velocity threshold, often attaining >95 average return within 5e4 env steps.",
