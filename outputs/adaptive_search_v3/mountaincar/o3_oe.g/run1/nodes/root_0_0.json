  "strategy": "Potential-Based Reward Shaping PPO (PBRS-PPO): keep vanilla PPO but reshape the environment reward with a dense, theoretically safe potential F(s,s\u2032)=\u03b3\u03a6(s\u2032)\u2212\u03a6(s).  Choose \u03a6(x,v)=\u03b1\u00b7x+\u03b2\u00b7v\u00b2, where x is position (\u22121.2\u20260.6) and v is velocity; \u03b1\u2248100 gives \u2248+100 potential gain from the start to the goal, \u03b2\u224810 encourages speed build-up.  The shaped reward r\u0303=r_env+F makes every uphill progress immediately positive while preserving the original optimal policy.  Train the value net on r\u0303 so advantages become informative from the first episode; at evaluation use the unshaped policy (weights unchanged).  To avoid over-shaping, multiply \u03a6 by a schedule \u03ba_t that linearly decays from 1 to 0 after 50 k real steps, handing the critic back to the true reward once the agent reliably reaches the goal.  Other hyper-tweaks: GAE \u03bb=0.9, entropy bonus start 0.01\u21920.0 over the same schedule.  This removes the early sparse-reward barrier without any model learning and typically attains >90 mean return in <60 k steps on MountainCarContinuous.",
