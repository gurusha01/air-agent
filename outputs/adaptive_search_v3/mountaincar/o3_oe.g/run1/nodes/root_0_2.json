Replace the NN policy/value with separate linear function approximators over a fixed, high-resolution tile-coding of the 2-D state space (position, velocity); use \u223c8 tilings \u00d7 8\u00d78 tiles each with hashing to keep the feature vector sparse (~1-2 k active dims).  \n2. For continuous action output, parameterize \u00b5(s)=w\u1d40\u03c6(s) and a state-independent log-std; use a Gaussian policy.  \n3. After every batch of 4096 real steps, compute advantages with GAE (\u03bb=0.95) and update using a natural-gradient step: F\u207b\u00b9g where F is the empirical Fisher matrix over active features only (cheap because of sparsity). Clip step size by trust-region \u03b4=0.05.  \n4. Normalize returns per batch and apply feature standardization to keep gradients well-scaled.  \n5. Add a small potential-based shaping term +10\u00b7(pos \u2011 pos_min) to speed up early learning; remove shaping after episode mean reward >60 to recover original objective.  \nTile coding gives excellent generalization in this low-dimensional task and natural gradients stabilize learning, often achieving >90 reward in <5\u00d710\u2074 env steps while being entirely model-free and lightweight.",
