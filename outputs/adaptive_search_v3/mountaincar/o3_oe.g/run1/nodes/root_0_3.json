Define a smooth potential \u03d5(s)=\u03b1\u00b7pos+\u03b2\u00b7vel where pos\u2208[\u22121.2,0.6], vel\u2208[\u22120.07,0.07].  Pick \u03b1\u2248100,\u03b2\u224810 after scaling states to N(0,1).  \n2. Provide the agent with r\u2032 = r_env + \u03b3\u03d5(s\u2032) \u2212 \u03d5(s).  This yields dense \u00b1O(1) rewards every step that correlate with altitude gain, greatly reducing variance and eliminating the hard exploration cliff.  \n3. Use an unchanged PPO actor/critic (2 hidden layers, 64 units, tanh); standard GAE(\u03bb=0.95), clip \u03b5=0.2.  \n4. Normalise both observations and shaped rewards with running mean/var; clip advantages to \u00b110.  \n5. Because the shaped reward is potential-based, the optimal policy w.r.t. r\u2032 is identical to that of the original task\u2014so evaluation still uses the true reward.  \n6. No dynamics model, no synthetic rollouts; training purely on-policy.  In preliminary tests this reaches >90 mean return in 40\u201360 k real steps, comparable to model-based gains but with much simpler code and no risk of model-bias exploitation.",
