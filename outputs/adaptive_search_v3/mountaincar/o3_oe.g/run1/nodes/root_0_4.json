  "strategy": "Distributional Critic PPO (QR-PPO): keep the standard PPO actor network but replace the scalar value head with a Quantile Regression critic that outputs N=51 quantiles of the return distribution Z(s) over a fixed support (e.g., \u03c4\u2208{0.01,\u2026,0.99}).  Train the critic with the Huber quantile loss against n-step returns (n=5) collected from the real environment, using an EMA target network to stabilize learning.  Compute the mean of the predicted quantiles \ud835\udd3c[Z(s)] and plug this into the usual GAE advantage calculation; the full distribution captures tail-risk and reduces value-function over/underestimation, yielding lower-variance advantages.  All other PPO settings stay unchanged (clip \u03b5=0.2, lr 3e-4, 2048-step batches, 4 epochs).  Add an exploration bonus equal to the critic\u2019s return standard-deviation \u03c3_Z(s) (scaled by 0.01) to encourage the agent toward states with high outcome uncertainty early in training, annealing the bonus to zero after 4\u00d710\u2074 env steps.  On MountainCarContinuous, distributional critics often learn the narrow \u201claunch window\u201d faster, reaching >95 mean reward within ~6\u00d710\u2074 env steps while staying robust to hyper-parameters.",
