  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-based reward shaping module that uses a learned dynamics model to predict the next state given current state and action, then computes a reward proportional to the predicted velocity gain and hill-climbing progress. This model is trained on a large dataset of simulated MountainCar transitions and uses a multi-layer perceptron with temporal convolutional layers to capture velocity dynamics and position transitions. The reward is dynamically scaled by a learned coefficient that adapts during training to maximize convergence speed without encouraging premature exploitation. This approach shifts from purely future-reward prediction to physics-informed shaping, enabling the agent to better understand momentum and energy transfer.",
