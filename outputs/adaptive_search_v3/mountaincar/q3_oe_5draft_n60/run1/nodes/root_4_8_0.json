  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-based reward shaping module using a learned dynamical system model (e.g., a neural ODE) trained to predict the future state evolution from current position and velocity. This model estimates the expected time to reach the goal under optimal control and outputs a continuous, state-dependent bonus that is scaled by a time-decay factor to encourage early action. The bonus is combined with the original reward using a fixed, learned coefficient trained via offline data. This approach replaces handcrafted milestones with a physically informed, trajectory-predictive reward that improves long-term planning without relying on expert demonstrations or explicit goal prediction.",
