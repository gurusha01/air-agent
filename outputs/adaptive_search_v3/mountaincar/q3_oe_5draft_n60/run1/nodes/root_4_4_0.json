  "strategy": "Introduce a reward shaping mechanism based on a physics-informed neural ordinary differential equation (PINN) that models the dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment. The PINN learns the underlying dynamics of the system (position and velocity evolution) and computes a reward that reflects the expected progress to the goal by predicting the future state trajectory. This reward is derived from the predicted distance to the goal at the next time step, adjusted by a learned function of current state and action, and applied in real time during training. The PINN is trained offline on simulated trajectories and updated every 1000 steps using gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.0005. This approach leverages physical intuition and differential modeling to provide a more accurate and stable reward signal than purely data-driven transformations.",
