  "strategy": "Introduce a velocity-based reward shaping mechanism using a sigmoidal function that gradually increases the reward for velocities above a dynamic threshold derived from the current position. The threshold adapts over time using a simple moving average of the agent\u2019s velocity during each episode, ensuring that the agent is incentivized to build momentum early on without overpenalizing low-velocity states. This approach replaces the learned scaling function with a deterministic, interpretable rule derived from physical intuition about the MountainCar dynamics, focusing on velocity as a proxy for action effectiveness.",
