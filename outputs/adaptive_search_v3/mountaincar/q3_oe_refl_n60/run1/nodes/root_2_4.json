The TD3 agent with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4 has achieved the best score of **49.7180**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and other variants. This success stems from TD3\u2019s inherent stability in continuous control tasks, its use of two Q-networks to reduce overestimation bias, and the effective noise injection that encourages exploration without destabilizing learning.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs**\u2014especially those attempting to process position/velocity as 2D grids or feature maps\u2014have either failed or yielded identical scores (e.g., root_2_0: FAIL, root_2_2_0: FAIL), likely due to the environment\u2019s low-dimensional, non-spatial state space. CNNs are ill-suited for such inputs, as they introduce unnecessary complexity and fail to capture meaningful spatial patterns. Recurrent architectures (e.g., LSTM) are also invalid due to the absence of temporal dependencies in MountainCarContinuous.  \n\n3. The next experiment should specifically **replace the fully connected network in TD3 with a more efficient and appropriate architecture**\u2014such as a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with batch normalization and a learning rate of 1e-4**, while fine-tuning the noise injection to a **Gaussian noise with sigma=0.1** and a **target smoothing factor of 0.001**\u2014to validate whether small architectural refinements (e.g., normalization, noise tuning) can further improve stability and performance without introducing failure..."
