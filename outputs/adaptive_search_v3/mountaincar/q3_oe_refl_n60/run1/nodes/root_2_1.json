Introduce a residual connection in the final policy head to improve gradient flow. Use a learning rate of 1e-3 and apply adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., AdamW with warm-up). Train for 5000 episodes with a batch size of 128 and a discount factor of 0.99, while enabling noise injection via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise with a higher noise intensity to enhance exploration. This approach leverages feature extraction from structured state representations, fundamentally different from fully connected networks.",

  "reflection": "The TD3 agent with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4 has achieved the best score of 49.7180, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and other variants like TD3 with discrete actions or DPNs, which failed or underperformed (e.g., root_1: -0.0423). This success highlights the effectiveness of continuous action spaces with noise injection and deterministic policy gradients, which stabilize learning and improve exploration in continuous control tasks like Mountain Car. In contrast, approaches involving CNNs (root_2_0: FAIL) have consistently failed, likely due to the absence of spatial features in the state space\u2014position and velocity are scalar, making CNNs redundant and computationally inefficient. Discrete action spaces and action freezing (root_1) have also failed, indicating that deterministic or discrete policies lack the fine-grained control needed for continuous dynamics. The next experiment should specifically expand root_2 by introducing **adaptive noise scaling** (e.g., noise amplitude dynamically adjusted based on agent velocity) to further improve exploration without destabilizing training. This refinement builds on the proven success of TD3 with ReLU and 1e-4 learning rate, targeting a more robust exploration strategy. A concrete hypothesis is that adaptive noise will push the agent beyond local optima, potentially increasing the reward mean beyond 49.7180."
