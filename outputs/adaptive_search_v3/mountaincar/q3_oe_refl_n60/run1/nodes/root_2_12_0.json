Introduce a state augmentation layer that computes momentum and potential energy as derived features, which enhances the policy\u2019s ability to anticipate future state transitions. Train the PPO agent using a learning rate of 1e-4 and disable adaptive noise during training, relying instead on entropy regularization (0.01 entropy coefficient) to encourage exploration without introducing stochasticity in action selection.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network (FCN) using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and even surpassing CNN-based variants. This success stems from the simplicity and effectiveness of FCNs in capturing the linear, low-dimensional dynamics of MountainCarContinuous, where complex spatial or temporal patterns are absent.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs** (e.g., root_2_1, root_2_2, root_2_5, root_2_7, root_2_9, root_2_10, root_2_11, root_2_12) have consistently failed or underperformed, with only root_2_12 scoring 49.7180\u2014likely due to misalignment with the environment\u2019s low-dimensional, non-spatial state space. Similarly, **RNNs and LSTMs** (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0, root_2_11_0, root_2_6) have failed or scored poorly (e.g., root_2_8: 44.3233), indicating that modeling temporal dynamics is unnecessary and counterproductive here.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network by introducing adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., cosine annealing)** and **adding noise injection with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise at a scaled variance of 0.1**, as this directly improves policy stability and exploration in continuous control tasks. This builds on the proven success of root_2 (49.7180) while addressing potential instability in training dynamics."
