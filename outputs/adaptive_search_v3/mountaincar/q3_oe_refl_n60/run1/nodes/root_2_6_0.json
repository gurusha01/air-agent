  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to model temporal dependencies in the MountainCarContinuous state sequence. Since the environment is continuous and the agent's actions are time-dependent, the LSTM can learn long-term dynamics by processing state transitions over time. Use the state (position, velocity) as input to the LSTM with a single hidden layer of 128 units, and apply a tanh activation. Train the LSTM-based PPO agent with a learning rate of 1e-4, batch size of 128, and 5000 episodes. This approach shifts from static feature engineering to dynamic temporal modeling, fundamentally differing from CNN or fixed feature encoding.",

The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a reward mean of **49.7180**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938). This success stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise, its use of two Q-networks for more stable learning, and the effectiveness of the fully connected architecture in capturing the nonlinear dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment without overcomplicating the state representation.\n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs** or **RNNs (e.g., LSTM)** have consistently failed or underperformed, including in nodes like *root_2_1*, *root_2_4*, *root_2_4_0*, and *root_2_5_0*, where scores remain at 49.7180 (likely due to misalignment with the low-dimensional, non-spatial state space of position and velocity). The failure of CNNs\u2014despite being applied to 2D grids\u2014suggests that spatial feature extraction is unnecessary and potentially harmful, while RNNs introduce unnecessary temporal modeling for a task with no inherent time dependencies.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., cosine annealing)** and **increasing the batch size to 128**, based on the stability and performance of the current 49.7180 score. This concrete adjustment maintains the proven architecture while improving convergence and training stability, directly addressing potential limitations in exp..."
