The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938) and outperforming all CNN and RNN variants. This suggests that the simple, direct mapping of position and velocity to a policy via a feedforward network is optimal for MountainCarContinuous, as the environment lacks complex spatial or temporal dependencies that would benefit from CNNs or RNNs.\n\n2. **CNN-based architectures have consistently failed or underperformed**, with all CNN variants (including root_2_1, root_2_2, root_2_3, root_2_4, root_2_5, root_2_6) either failing to improve or yielding identical scores (49.7180) despite elaborate justifications\u2014indicating that treating 1D state inputs as 2D grids or feature maps is unnecessary and likely detrimental due to the low-dimensional, non-spatial nature of the state space. Similarly, **RNNs (especially LSTMs)** have failed in all attempts (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0), with no performance gain and clear failure messages, suggesting temporal modeling is irrelevant here.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent\u2019s hyperparameters**\u2014specifically, **tune the learning rate (e.g., 5e-4 or 1e-3), noise injection strength (e.g., 0.1\u20130.3), and target network update frequency**\u2014while keeping the fully connected network with ReLU activations.
