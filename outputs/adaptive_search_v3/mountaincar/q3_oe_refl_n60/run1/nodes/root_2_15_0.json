  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a Transformer-based architecture, treating the trajectory history (position and velocity over time) as a sequence of tokens. Each time step is encoded as a vector, and the Transformer learns long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the environment dynamics. Use a small feedforward transformer with a single layer and a learning rate of 1e-4. Introduce a reward shaping that penalizes oscillatory behavior and rewards sustained momentum toward the goal. This approach fundamentally shifts from spatial abstraction to temporal sequence modeling, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture dynamics over time.",

The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a reward mean of **49.7180**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938). This success likely stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise, its use of two Q-networks for improved stability, and the effective handling of continuous action spaces\u2014critical in Mountain Car Continuous.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs**\u2014especially those attempting to process position/velocity as 2D grids or feature maps\u2014have consistently failed or underperformed (e.g., root_2_8: 44.3233, root_2_14: FAIL), likely due to the environment\u2019s low-dimensional, non-spatial state space, where spatial convolutional patterns are irrelevant. Similarly, **RNNs and LSTMs** (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0) have failed or caused errors, indicating that temporal dynamics are not present or useful in this task. Physics-informed or feature-engineered approaches (e.g., root_2_10_0) also failed, suggesting that such abstractions are not beneficial here.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** (as in root_2), specifically by **adding adaptive noise injection (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise) with a scaled variance of 0.1** and **increasing the learning rate slightly to 1.5e-4** to improve exploration in the flat reward landscape. This builds directly on the successful root_2 strategy while addressing potential exploration limitation..."
