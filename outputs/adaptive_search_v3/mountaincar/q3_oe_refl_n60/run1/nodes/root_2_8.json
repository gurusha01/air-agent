Train with a learning rate of 1e-3 and enable gradient clipping at 0.5 to stabilize training. Use a modified PPO algorithm with a value function clipping range of 0.2 to improve policy stability.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing strategy so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a reward mean of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938). This success stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise, its use of twin Q-networks for more stable learning, and the suitability of a simple fully connected network for the low-dimensional, continuous state-action space of MountainCarContinuous.\n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs**\u2014especially those attempting to process position and velocity as 2D grids or feature maps\u2014have consistently failed or yielded identical scores (49.7180), likely due to the environment\u2019s low dimensionality and lack of spatial structure. Similarly, **RNNs (LSTM)** and **transformer-based models** have failed or been marked as \"FAIL\" or untested, indicating that modeling temporal dynamics is unnecessary and computationally wasteful in this environment. These architectures introduce complexity without benefit.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent by introducing adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., cosine annealing)** and **increasing the noise injection strength (e.g., from 0.1 to 0.3)** in the policy network, as noise is critical for exploration in continuous control. This is a direct, data-driven improvement on the proven baseline, with hyperparameters grounded in known best practices for TD3 in continuous control tasks."
