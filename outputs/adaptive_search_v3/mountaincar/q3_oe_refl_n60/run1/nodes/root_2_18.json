The best-performing strategies so far are those using **TD3 with fully connected networks (FCNs) with ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a peak score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938) and outperforming all CNN-based variants. This suggests that the simple, direct mapping of position and velocity to a fully connected network is optimal for MountainCarContinuous, as the environment lacks complex spatial or temporal dependencies that CNNs are designed to exploit.\n\n2. **CNN-based architectures have consistently failed or underperformed**, with several experiments scoring **44.3233 (root_2_8)** or worse, and some failing outright (e.g., root_2_14: FAIL, root_2_16: -16.3839). Notably, attempts to apply CNNs with 2D grid representations or spatial convolutions (e.g., root_2_1, root_2_2, root_2_7) either fail or yield only marginal gains, likely due to the low-dimensional, non-spatial nature of the state space. Similarly, **RNNs and LSTMs (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0)** have failed or underperformed, indicating that modeling temporal dynamics is unnecessary and potentially harmful in this task.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **physics-informed feature engineering**\u2014specifically, using **acceleration and jerk features derived from position and velocity** (as in root_2_10_0), which has shown promise in similar environments. This approach maintains the proven success..."
