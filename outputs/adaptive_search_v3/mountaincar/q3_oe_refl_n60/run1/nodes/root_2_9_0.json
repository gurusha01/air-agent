Use a self-attention mechanism to model long-range dependencies in the dynamics of the MountainCar environment. Introduce a feedforward layer to project the attention output into the policy and value function heads. Apply a time-aware masking strategy to handle variable-length trajectories, and use a learning rate of 3e-4 with a cosine annealing schedule. This approach leverages the ability of Transformers to capture temporal patterns in continuous state sequences, which may improve trajectory planning in a non-Markovian setting.",

The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938) and outperforming all CNN and RNN variants. This success likely stems from the simplicity and effectiveness of TD3 in continuous control tasks, combined with stable policy updates via target networks and noise injection, which are well-suited to the MountainCarContinuous environment\u2019s non-linear dynamics.\n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs** (e.g., root_2_1, root_2_2, root_2_5, root_2_6, root_2_7, root_2_9) have consistently failed or underperformed, with only **root_2_8** (44.3233) showing moderate improvement\u2014still below the TD3 baseline. This suggests that the state space (position and velocity) is low-dimensional and lacks spatial structure, making CNNs inefficient and potentially overfitting. Similarly, **RNNs and LSTMs** (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0) have failed due to the absence of temporal dependencies in the environment, and attempts to model trajectories as sequences are not justified by the task\u2019s dynamics.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent by introducing a physics-informed latent space**\u2014specifically, preprocessing the state (position and velocity) through a small dynamical system (e.g., a linearized model of the MountainCar dynamics) to create a more meaningful latent representation. This builds on the promising **root_2_1_0** ..."
