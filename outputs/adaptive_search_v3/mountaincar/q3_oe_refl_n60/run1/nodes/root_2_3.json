Apply batch normalization after each convolutional layer and use a learning rate of 1e-3 to accelerate convergence. Introduce a custom reward shaping function that adds a small positive bonus when the car approaches the goal hill to encourage faster learning.

The TD3 agent with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4 has achieved the best score of **49.7180**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and other variants. This success stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise, its use of two Q-networks for more stable learning, and its effective handling of continuous action spaces\u2014critical in the Mountain Car environment where fine-grained control is needed.\n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs** on the Mountain Car state space (e.g., root_2_1 and root_2_2) have either failed or yielded identical scores, suggesting that the input state (position and velocity) is inherently low-dimensional and lacks spatial structure that CNNs are designed to exploit. Similarly, **RNNs (LSTM)** have failed outright, indicating that temporal dependencies in the state are not present or useful in this environment\u2014where the dynamics are deterministic and short-term memory is unnecessary.\n\n3. The next experiment should specifically **replace the fully connected network in TD3 with a more efficient and scalable architecture that preserves the state\u2019s low-dimensional nature**, such as a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with batch normalization and layer-wise dropout**, while fine-tuning the learning rate to **5e-4** and introducing **additive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise** (as in the original TD3) to improve exploration. This maintains the proven success of TD3 while systematically improving stability and performance thro..."
