  "strategy": "Replace the neural network architecture with a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer, to model the temporal dynamics of the MountainCarContinuous environment. The LSTM will process the state sequence (position and velocity over time) to capture long-range dependencies in the car's motion, enabling better prediction of future trajectories. The LSTM output is passed through a fully connected layer followed by a tanh activation to ensure bounded action outputs. Use a learning rate of 5e-4 and incorporate a state-dependent reward shaping mechanism that enhances the gradient signal during early training phases. This approach fundamentally shifts from static feature extraction to temporal modeling.",

The best-performing approach so far is the **TD3 agent with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and all other variants. This success likely stems from TD3\u2019s inherent stability in continuous control tasks, its use of target policy smoothing, and its robustness to noise, which aligns well with the MountainCarContinuous environment\u2019s need for smooth, persistent action selection.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include **RNNs (especially LSTM)** and **physics-informed latent space modeling**\u2014notably, experiments like *root_2_4_0*, *root_2_5_0*, *root_2_6_0*, *root_2_11_0*, and *root_2_12_0* either failed or underperformed (e.g., *root_2_12_0* failed with error, *root_2_14* failed). These models introduce unnecessary complexity for a low-dimensional, non-sequential environment where temporal dynamics are minimal and no memory is needed. Similarly, **CNNs applied to 2D grids** (e.g., *root_2_1*, *root_2_7*, *root_2_13*) have not improved performance despite being theoretically plausible\u2014suggesting that spatial convolution is ill-suited for scalar state inputs (position and velocity).\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the existing TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **physics-informed feature engineering**\u2014specifically, adding time-derivative features such as acceleration (derived from velocit..."
