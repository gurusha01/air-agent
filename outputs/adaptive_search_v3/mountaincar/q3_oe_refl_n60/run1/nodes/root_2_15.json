  "strategy": "Replace the fully connected network with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, despite the MountainCarContinuous environment having a low-dimensional state space. Introduce spatial feature abstraction by treating the car position and velocity as a 2D grid input (e.g., discretized into 16x16 tiles), allowing the CNN to learn structured patterns in state dynamics. Use a small CNN with ReLU activations, a batch normalization layer after each convolution, and a learning rate of 5e-4. Train with the same PPO framework, but with a modified reward shaping that encourages reaching the goal more efficiently. This strategy introduces a fundamentally different model architecture (CNN vs. fully connected) and leverages spatial abstraction in a non-physical context.",

The best-performing approaches so far are those using **TD3 with fully connected networks (FCNs) with ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving the best score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938) and the only successful CNN variants (e.g., root_2_1, root_2_9). This suggests that **simple, well-tuned FCNs** are more effective than complex architectures like CNNs or RNNs in this low-dimensional, non-visual environment where spatial structure is absent.  \n\n2. **CNNs and RNNs (especially LSTM)** have consistently failed or underperformed, with scores either failing (e.g., root_2_0, root_2_2_0, root_2_12_0) or dropping to **44.3233** (root_2_8), indicating that forcing spatial or temporal modeling in a state space with no inherent grid or sequence structure leads to poor performance. Notably, **physics-informed feature engineering** (e.g., root_2_10_0) and **transformer-based models** (e.g., root_2_7_0, root_2_9_0) also failed or were not tested due to LLM errors, suggesting these are not viable without proper implementation.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., cosine annealing)** and **increasing the batch size to 128**, based on the proven success of TD3 with FCNs. This is a concrete, low-risk improvement that builds on the best-performing strategy (root_2) and avoids the failure-prone complexity of CNNs or RNNs."
