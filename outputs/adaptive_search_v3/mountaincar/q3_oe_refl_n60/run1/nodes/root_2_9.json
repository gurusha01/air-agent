The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network (FCN) using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938) and outperforming all CNN-based variants. This suggests that the simple, low-dimensional state space of MountainCarContinuous does not benefit from complex architectures like CNNs, which are designed for spatial data and may introduce unnecessary complexity and overfitting.\n\n2. **CNN-based approaches have consistently failed or underperformed**, with only one variant (root_2_8) scoring 44.3233\u2014still below the TD3-FCN baseline. Notably, attempts to use CNNs with 2D grids or feature maps (e.g., root_2_1, root_2_2, root_2_3, root_2_5, root_2_6, root_2_7) either failed (root_2_0, root_2_2_0) or yielded suboptimal results. Additionally, **RNNs and LSTM-based models (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0)** have failed due to the absence of temporal dynamics in the environment, as MountainCarContinuous is a Markov process with no memory.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3-FCN baseline by introducing adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., cosine annealing)** and **increasing the batch size to 256**, as these hyperparameters have been shown to improve convergence in continuous control tasks. This specific, concrete direction maintains the proven architecture (TD3 + FCN + ReLU + 1e-4 LR) while systematically improving training stability and performance, wi..."
