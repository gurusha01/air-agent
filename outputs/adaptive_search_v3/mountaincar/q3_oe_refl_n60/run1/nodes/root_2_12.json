  "strategy": "Replace the fully connected network with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, despite the MountainCarContinuous task having a simple, low-dimensional state space, by applying a 1D convolution layer on the state representation (position and velocity) to capture local patterns. Use batch normalization after each convolutional layer, and introduce a residual connection to improve gradient flow. Train with a learning rate of 5e-5, and apply adaptive noise (Gaussian noise with dynamic variance) during action selection to enhance exploration. Enable target network updates every 500 steps to accelerate policy convergence. This approach introduces a fundamentally different model architecture (CNN vs. fully connected) while maintaining continuous action space dynamics.",

The best-performing strategies so far are those using **TD3 with fully connected networks (FCNs) with ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving the best score of **49.7180**\u2014significantly above the baseline (33.7938) and outperforming all CNN-based variants. This suggests that the simple, low-dimensional state space of MountainCarContinuous does not benefit from complex architectures like CNNs, which are designed for spatial data, and that a well-tuned FCN with standard activation and learning rate settings is optimal.\n\n2. **CNN-based approaches consistently fail or underperform**, with only **root_2_8** (44.3233) showing moderate success, while others (e.g., root_2_0, root_2_2_0, root_2_4_0) result in **FAIL** or are not superior. This indicates that forcing CNNs on a 2D state (position/velocity) without spatial structure or meaningful feature maps is ineffective. Similarly, **RNNs and LSTMs** (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0) have not improved performance and likely fail due to the environment\u2019s lack of temporal dependencies\u2014no need for memory or sequence modeling.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **physics-informed latent features**\u2014specifically, using a **physics-based feature engineering approach** (as in root_2_10_0) to extract time-derivative features like acceleration or jerk derived from position and velocity. This is supported by the fact that root_2_10_0 (score: 49.7180..."
