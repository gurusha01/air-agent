The best-performing strategies so far are the TD3 agent with a fully connected network (ReLU, learning rate 1e-4) and its variants using CNNs with spatial processing of position and velocity\u2014specifically, **root_2**, **root_2_1**, and **root_2_9** all achieving the best score of **49.7180**, indicating that simple, well-tuned feedforward networks with proper noise injection and TD3\u2019s stability mechanisms work exceptionally well in Mountain Car Continuous. The CNN-based approaches, despite the environment\u2019s low dimensionality, do not degrade performance, suggesting that spatial abstraction is not necessary here.\n\n2. The **RNN-based strategies (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0)** consistently fail or underperform (e.g., **root_2_8: 44.3233**, a significant drop), indicating that modeling temporal dynamics with LSTM is unnecessary and likely harmful due to the environment\u2019s lack of long-term dependencies. Similarly, **root_2_0** and **root_2_2_0** failed due to invalid or ill-defined state processing, showing that CNNs applied to 1D state vectors without proper feature engineering or discretization are unstable.\n\n3. The next experiment should specifically test **root_2_10_0**\u2014a physics-based feature engineering approach using time-derivative features like acceleration and jerk\u2014by replacing the state input with a continuous, physics-informed representation derived from position and velocity.
