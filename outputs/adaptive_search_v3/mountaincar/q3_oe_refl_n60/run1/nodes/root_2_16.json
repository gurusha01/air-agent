This introduces spatial feature learning, which may better capture the dynamics of the MountainCar environment. Use a learning rate of 5e-4, train for 6000 episodes with batch size 128, and apply Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise with a noise scale of 0.1. Enable target network updates every 1000 steps and use a discount factor of 0.99. This approach shifts from a purely feature-extraction-based model to a spatially aware one, fundamentally different from fully connected networks.",

The best-performing strategies so far are those using **TD3 with fully connected networks (FCNs) with ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving the best score of **49.7180**\u2014a significant improvement over the baseline (33.7938) and over all CNN-based variants. The **root_2** experiment (TD3 with FCN) is the only one with a score above 49.7, indicating that simple, well-tuned FCNs with standard policy gradients outperform complex architectures in this low-dimensional, deterministic environment.\n\n2. **CNN-based approaches** have consistently underperformed or failed\u2014despite multiple attempts (e.g., root_2_1, root_2_2, root_2_5, root_2_9, root_2_15), with only **root_2_1** and **root_2_9** achieving the same 49.7180 score, and others failing or scoring only 44.3233 (root_2_8). Notably, **RNNs (LSTM)** and **Transformer-based models** have failed or been marked as \"FAIL\" (e.g., root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_12_0), likely due to the absence of temporal dynamics in MountainCarContinuous, where state transitions are deterministic and short-term memory is unnecessary. Physics-informed or derivative-based feature engineering (e.g., root_2_10_0) also failed, suggesting such features are not beneficial here.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **adaptive learning rate scheduling (e.g., cosine annealing)** and **increasing the batch size to 1024**, based on known stability improvements in TD3.
