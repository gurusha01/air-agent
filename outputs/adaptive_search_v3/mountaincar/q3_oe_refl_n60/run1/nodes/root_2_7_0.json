The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a fully connected network using ReLU activations and a learning rate of 1e-4**, achieving a reward mean of **49.7180**\u2014significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and other variants. This success stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise, its use of two Q-networks for more stable value estimation, and the effectiveness of the fully connected architecture in modeling the simple, low-dimensional state space (position and velocity) without overfitting or unnecessary complexity.\n\n2. Approaches involving **CNNs** or **RNNs (e.g., LSTM)** have consistently failed or resulted in **FAIL** or negligible performance (e.g., root_2_0, root_2_4_0, root_2_5_0, root_2_6_0), likely due to the absence of spatial or temporal structure in the MountainCarContinuous state space. The environment has only two scalar inputs (position, velocity), making CNNs and RNNs computationally inefficient and conceptually misaligned\u2014especially since CNNs require 2D grids and RNNs assume sequential dependencies that don\u2019t exist here.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the TD3 agent with a fully connected network** by introducing **adaptive noise scaling** (e.g., noise amplitude dynamically adjusted based on state proximity to the goal), using the same hyperparameters (ReLU, 1e-4 learning rate), and testing a **smaller network depth (e.g., 2 hidden layers of 64 units)** to improve training stability and convergence speed. This builds on the proven succes..."
