  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to augment the dynamics model by embedding the known physical equations of the MountainCar system (e.g., Newtonian mechanics for position and velocity dynamics) directly into the loss function during training. This ensures that the learned dynamics model respects physical constraints, improving trajectory prediction accuracy and stability, especially in long-horizon planning. The PINN is trained in parallel with the policy network using a hybrid loss combining MSE on state transitions and a regularization term enforcing conservation of energy and momentum. This approach reduces overfitting to noisy replay data and improves generalization in unseen scenarios.",

This success stems from TD3\u2019s robustness to noise, its use of twin Q-networks for more stable learning, and the adaptive noise scaling, which prevents policy collapse during exploration. In contrast, the DDPG-based approach (root_0) failed catastrophically with a score of -28.6957, likely due to insufficient noise stability and lack of target network updates. Noise injection alone (root_1) yielded only a marginal improvement (still 49.7180), suggesting that structured noise via a learned noise layer is more effective than ad hoc injection. The hybrid policy with a learned dynamics model (root_2_0) maintains the same high score, indicating that dynamics modeling may not be necessary for performance on Mountain Car, where the environment is simple and deterministic. The next experiment should specifically test a **TD3 agent with a learned state-action dynamics model embedded in the policy network**, using a small LSTM to predict next state transitions and feeding that into a Gaussian policy with adaptive noise, while keeping the same architecture and hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate 3e-4, batch size 64, gamma 0.99, tau 0.005) to isolate the impact of dynamics modeling. This will determine whether learned dynamics provide a meaningful advantage or merely add c..."
