  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) where the policy is augmented with a physical model of the MountainCar dynamics (e.g., Newtonian equations of motion) embedded as prior knowledge. This model acts as a regularizer during training, constraining action policies to respect physical feasibility (e.g., preventing actions that would cause negative velocity or violate momentum conservation). The PINN is trained alongside the PPO policy using a hybrid loss that combines policy objective with a fidelity term measuring deviation from physical laws. This improves stability and guides exploration toward physically plausible trajectories, reducing random exploration in high-dimensional continuous spaces.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a Gaussian policy and adaptive noise scaling** (root_2: 49.7180), which significantly outperforms the baseline (33.7938) and even surpasses the original PPO baseline. This success stems from TD3\u2019s stability in continuous control domains, its use of twin Q-networks to reduce overestimation bias, and the adaptive noise layer that improves exploration without destabilizing learning. In contrast, approaches like behavioral cloning (root_2_1) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) \u2014 while theoretically sound \u2014 have not yielded performance gains, likely due to insufficient data or poor generalization from simulated expert trajectories. The hybrid DDPG with autoencoders (root_2_2) is currently the only sibling under evaluation, and its score remains at 49.7180, suggesting it may be on the edge of performance but lacks clear differentiation from the baseline TD3. Given that TD3 with adaptive noise has already achieved the best score, the next experiment should **specifically test a TD3 agent with a learned latent representation using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to compress state space, with a 128-unit hidden layer and a KL-divergence regularization coefficient of 0.01**, to assess whether latent space learning improves generalization and convergence speed without sacrificing reward. This maintains the proven TD3 architecture while introducing a concrete, measurable enhancement in state representation."
