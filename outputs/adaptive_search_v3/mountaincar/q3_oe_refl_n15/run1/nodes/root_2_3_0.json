  "strategy": "Replace the SAC framework with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using a state-action representation that encodes both position and velocity in a sinusoidal embedding space to capture periodic dynamics. This transformation allows the agent to model the inherently cyclic nature of the MountainCarContinuous environment more effectively by mapping continuous state variables into a periodic latent space, improving trajectory prediction and policy stability during exploration. Additionally, apply a learned trajectory smoothing layer to reduce oscillations during transitions, which helps the agent avoid energy-intensive oscillations common in sparse-reward settings.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **TD3 with a Gaussian policy and adaptive noise scaling**, achieving a score of **49.7180**, significantly outperforming the baseline (33.7938) and even outperforming other variants like DDPG or SAC. This success stems from TD3\u2019s inherent stability in continuous control tasks, combined with adaptive noise that prevents policy collapse and enables smoother exploration. In contrast, approaches like behavioral cloning (root_2_1) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) \u2014 while theoretically sound \u2014 have not improved scores, likely due to poor generalization or overfitting to simulated expert trajectories. The hybrid architectures (e.g., root_2_0, root_2_2) and multi-scale SAC (root_2_3) have not yet yielded better results, suggesting that complex feature engineering or latent representations may not provide sufficient gains without strong signal alignment. The next experiment should specifically expand **root_2_3** by introducing a **multi-scale state representation** that explicitly encodes position, velocity, and a learned momentum feature derived from the physics of the MountainCar system (i.e., $ F = m a $), using a **two-layer feedforward network with batch normalization** and **learning rate decay of 1e-4** to stabilize training. This maintains the core TD3 stability while enhancing state expressiveness in a physically grounded way, directly addressing the known limitations of flat state representations in this environment."
