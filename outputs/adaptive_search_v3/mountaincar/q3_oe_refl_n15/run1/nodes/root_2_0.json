  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid policy architecture combining a feedforward neural network with a learned dynamics model (using a recurrent neural network, specifically an LSTM) to predict future state transitions based on current state and action. This enables the agent to plan ahead by simulating trajectories and selecting actions that maximize expected future rewards, effectively turning the exploration into a form of temporal reasoning. The dynamics model is trained offline on replay buffer data and used during training to guide action selection via a risk-sensitive reward shaping mechanism. This approach shifts the agent from reactive policy learning to a predictive, planning-based strategy, which is particularly effective in sparse-reward environments like MountainCarContinuous.",

  "reflection": "The TD3 agent with a Gaussian policy and a separate noise layer\u2014specifically the **root_2** experiment achieving a score of **49.7180**\u2014has worked best because it combines the stability of TD3 with adaptive noise scaling, which helps the agent explore effectively without destabilizing learning. This outperforms both root_1 (\u22120.0099) and root_0 (\u221228.6957), where noise injection or simpler DDPG variants failed due to poor exploration or instability in policy updates. The failure of root_0, which used a standard DDPG with ReLU and experience replay, suggests that **non-adaptive noise and lack of target policy smoothing** hinder convergence. Similarly, root_1\u2019s noise injection without adaptive scaling led to minimal reward, indicating that **static noise levels are ineffective** in the Mountain Car environment. The next concrete direction should be to **add a learned noise scaling function** (e.g., a small MLP that outputs noise amplitude per state) to the TD3 agent, specifically targeting the noise layer in the policy\u2019s action distribution, and evaluate its impact on reward mean\u2014this builds directly on root_2\u2019s success while testing a refinement of the noise mechanism. This experiment should use the same architecture (Gaussian policy, twin Q-networks, target smoothing) but introduce a **state-dependent noise scaling layer** with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 1024 to ensure stability and scalability."
