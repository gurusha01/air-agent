  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic trajectory weighting mechanism where episodes are reweighted based on their final reward, and during training, the agent is encouraged to focus on trajectories that are close to the goal state (e.g., position > 0.5) using a reward shaping function that increases the gradient signal for states near the goal. This is implemented via a temporal difference loss that applies a geometric decay to the importance of early timesteps, emphasizing late-stage policy decisions. The reward function is augmented with a penalty for oscillations in velocity, which is computed as the variance of velocity over the last 5 timesteps. This approach shifts the agent's focus from generic state-action patterns to goal-directed motion planning, directly addressing the long-horizon planning challenge in MountainCarContinuous.",
