  "strategy": "Replace the CNN-based state encoder with a graph neural network (GNN) that models the state space as a dynamic graph where nodes represent discrete time steps and edges encode transitions between position and velocity. Each node captures the current state (position, velocity), and edges capture temporal dependencies through learned transition weights. The GNN learns global state dynamics by aggregating information across time steps, enabling it to detect long-range dependencies and complex oscillatory behaviors in MountainCar. The action policy is derived from a GNN output followed by a fully connected layer. This approach fundamentally shifts from spatial pattern recognition to relational modeling of state transitions, capturing causal structure between time steps.",
