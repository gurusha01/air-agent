  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) to model the state-action dynamics of MountainCarContinuous by representing each state as a node in a dynamic graph. The graph is constructed where each state in the sequence is connected to its immediate predecessor and successor, forming a temporal edge structure. The GNN processes this graph structure to capture both local transitions and long-range dependencies through message passing. Action output is derived from a final readout layer over the graph states. Use a dynamic graph structure that adapts the connectivity based on velocity thresholds to emphasize regions of high dynamical activity. Apply curriculum learning by gradually increasing the sequence length during training to stabilize convergence.",
