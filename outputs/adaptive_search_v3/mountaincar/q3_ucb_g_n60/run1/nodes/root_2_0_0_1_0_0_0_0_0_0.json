  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural ordinary differential equation (PINN) to model the underlying dynamics of the MountainCar environment. Instead of relying on a learned reward shaping network, the PINN learns the true dynamics of the system (e.g., force vs. position/velocity) by minimizing the residual of the physics equations (Newton's laws) over time. This provides a more accurate and stable model of the system dynamics, which is then used to derive a continuous, differentiable reward function that directly encourages stable momentum and avoids local minima. The PPO agent trains on this physics-derived reward, which is updated incrementally during training using a temporal difference error on the predicted dynamics. This approach shifts the focus from reward shaping to dynamics modeling, offering a fundamentally different foundation than IRL-based shaping or trajectory-based feedback.",
