  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid policy architecture using a learned discrete-time physics model with a residual correction layer that enforces energy conservation at each time step. Instead of continuous neural ODEs, the model uses a feedforward network to predict the next state based on position and velocity, then applies a residual correction that adjusts the predicted velocity to ensure energy conservation (e.g., using the exact relation E = 0.5*m*v\u00b2 + m*g*h). This correction is applied per time step during training, and the policy is optimized to maximize reward while minimizing the correction magnitude. This approach avoids the complexity of continuous dynamics while still embedding physical constraints directly into the state transition process.",
