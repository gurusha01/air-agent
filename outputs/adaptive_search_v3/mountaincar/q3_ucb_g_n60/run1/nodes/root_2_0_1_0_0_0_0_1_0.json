  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid state representation that combines physics-informed features (e.g., velocity, potential energy, kinetic energy) with a low-dimensional handcrafted feature vector derived from the state space, such as normalized position and velocity differences over time. This enriched state representation is fed directly into the PPO policy, enabling the agent to learn control actions based on physically meaningful signals while preserving the continuity of the dynamics. The features are precomputed offline using trajectory sampling from the environment and are updated periodically during training to adapt to learned dynamics. This approach avoids latent space modeling and instead leverages explicit physical quantities as actionable inputs.",
