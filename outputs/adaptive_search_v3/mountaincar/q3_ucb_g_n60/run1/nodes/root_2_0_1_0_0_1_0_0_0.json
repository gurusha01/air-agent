  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid policy that combines a physics-informed neural network (PINN) with a state-dependent action scaling mechanism. Instead of using Hamiltonian ODEs, the policy is modeled as a PINN that learns the dynamics of the MountainCar system while explicitly enforcing physical constraints (e.g., energy conservation) through residual losses during training. The action space is scaled based on the current position and velocity using a learned gating function derived from the system\u2019s phase space geometry, improving action precision in low-energy regions. This strategy replaces the continuous dynamical system with a data-driven but physically constrained model, focusing on action robustness in critical regions.",
