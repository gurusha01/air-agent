  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid policy with a momentum-aware attention mechanism that dynamically weights past velocity history to improve action continuity. Instead of using raw (position, velocity) as input, the state is augmented with a temporal attention module that computes weighted contributions of past velocities, emphasizing momentum persistence. This encourages smoother, physically plausible motion and reduces oscillations common in MountainCar. The attention weights are learned during training and updated per episode to adapt to varying energy landscapes.",
