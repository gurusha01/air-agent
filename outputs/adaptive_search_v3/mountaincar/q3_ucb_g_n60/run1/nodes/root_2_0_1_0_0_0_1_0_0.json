  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-guided latent space representation using a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on state-action trajectories to project high-dimensional state observations into a low-dimensional latent space that preserves physical invariants such as energy conservation and momentum balance. During PPO training, the policy is conditioned on latent variables that are enforced to evolve according to a learned physics-consistent dynamics model (e.g., a learned ODE in latent space), ensuring that actions are physically plausible by construction. The latent space is updated during rollout via a denoising autoencoder that reconstructs states from the action sequence, with reconstruction loss penalizing violations of energy conservation over time.",
