  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid discrete-continuous action space by augmenting the policy with a discrete action selector that dynamically chooses between smooth continuous actions and high-impact \"reset\" actions during low-energy states. The reset actions are triggered when the car's velocity falls below a threshold and the position is near the bottom hill, allowing the agent to perform a sudden jerk action to escape local minima. This strategy leverages the non-convexity of the MountainCar environment by introducing controlled discontinuities in action space, which can break reward stagnation and enable escape from dead zones. The PINN-generated dynamics are used to predict when such resets are likely to succeed, improving action timing and success rate.",
