  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-guided latent space representation where the state (position and velocity) is projected into a latent space using a learned physics-invariant transformation (e.g., via a neural ODE or a Fourier-based feature map). This latent space captures conserved quantities such as energy and momentum more explicitly, enabling the policy to operate on a more stable, physically meaningful manifold. The PPO policy is trained directly in this latent space, which reduces the risk of oscillations and improves trajectory consistency during momentum buildup. This approach replaces the high-level planner with a direct policy that learns from physics-informed latent features.",
