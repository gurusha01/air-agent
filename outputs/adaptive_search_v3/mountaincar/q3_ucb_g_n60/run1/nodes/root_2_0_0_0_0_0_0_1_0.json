  "strategy": "Introduce a momentum-based feature vector where the policy network receives a dynamically computed momentum term derived from the velocity history (e.g., a running average of the last 4 velocity steps) and a smoothed position change over time. This momentum feature is scaled by a learnable coefficient and concatenated with the raw state. The momentum term acts as a proxy for the agent's \"inertia\" or \"tendency to continue moving in a certain direction,\" helping the agent avoid abrupt reversals and maintain momentum during the uphill climb. This approach is fundamentally different from temporal delay, as it uses a learned, adaptive dynamical system rather than static lagged inputs.",
