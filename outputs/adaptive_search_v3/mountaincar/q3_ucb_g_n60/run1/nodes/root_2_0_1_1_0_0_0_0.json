  "strategy": "Replace the CNN-based spatial trajectory encoding with a temporal graph neural network (GNN) that models the state trajectory as a dynamic graph where each time step is a node, and edges represent temporal dependencies (e.g., velocity transitions or position changes). The GNN learns relational patterns across time steps\u2014such as momentum propagation or critical turning points\u2014by aggregating information from neighboring time steps. Action selection is derived from a learned graph-based policy head that emphasizes high-impact transitions, enabling better anticipation of the mountain\u2019s steep regions. This approach shifts from spatial encoding to relational temporal modeling, fundamentally different from both CNN and sequential RNNs.",
