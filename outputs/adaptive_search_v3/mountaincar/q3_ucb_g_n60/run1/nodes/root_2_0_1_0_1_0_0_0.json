  "strategy": "Introduce a discrete-time stochastic control policy with learned noise injection and trajectory regularization, where the action is sampled from a Gaussian distribution centered around a learned control policy that minimizes a weighted sum of position deviation and momentum variance. The noise injection is adaptive, increasing during low-reward episodes to encourage exploration, while trajectory regularization enforces smoothness in state transitions using a sliding-window L2 penalty on adjacent states. This approach uses a simple feedforward policy network with a low-dimensional latent representation of the state, avoiding Hamiltonian or symplectic modeling entirely. The training objective combines mean reward maximization with a penalty on action variance to prevent overcommitment to suboptimal actions.",
