  "strategy": "Introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework where the environment is decomposed into two levels: a high-level planner that selects between coarse action modes (e.g., \"accelerate\", \"coast\", \"recover\"), and a low-level policy that executes fine-grained actions within each mode. The high-level policy is trained using a simple Q-learning approach on a reward signal derived from the state's distance to the energy wells, while the low-level policy uses a standard DDPG with state-dependent noise. This separation reduces the complexity of the action space and enables better long-term planning, which is critical in MountainCarContinuous where success requires sustained momentum. The hierarchical structure promotes robustness by ensuring that the agent first commits to a viable strategy before refining its actions.",
