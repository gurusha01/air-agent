Use self-attention to model long-term dependencies in velocity dynamics, enabling the agent to anticipate the need for sustained thrust before the energy barrier. Train using PPO with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a value function clip of 0.1, and apply experience replay with prioritized sampling using beta=0.8 to focus on episodes with high temporal coherence in velocity patterns.",
