  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic reward shaping mechanism using a learned velocity prediction model that predicts future velocity based on current state and action. The agent receives a reward proportional to the predicted increase in velocity over a 10-step horizon, with a smoothing factor to prevent overfitting to short-term fluctuations. This approach shifts reward design from fixed thresholds to a model-based forecast, enabling the agent to learn velocity dynamics more effectively. The model is trained in parallel with the PPO agent using a small subset of expert demonstrations from successful trajectories.",
