  "strategy": "Replace the Transformer-based state processor with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-enhanced recurrent neural network (RNN) that explicitly models temporal distortions in the MountainCarContinuous environment. Instead of treating time steps as uniformly spaced, DTW warps the sequence to align similar trajectories (e.g., slow climbs vs. fast dives), allowing the RNN to learn more robust temporal patterns. The RNN\u2019s hidden state is updated using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with attention over warped time steps, capturing both short-term dynamics and long-term goals. Action decisions are made via a separate MLP head conditioned on the warped state. Introduce a dynamic reward shaping function that scales rewards based on the alignment quality of the warped trajectory, using a learned DTW cost function to penalize inefficient paths. This approach leverages non-linear temporal alignment to improve policy learning in environments with variable time scales.",
