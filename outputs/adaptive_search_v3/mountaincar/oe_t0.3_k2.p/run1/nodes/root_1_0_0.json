  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) where the policy is augmented with a learned dynamical model that encodes the known physics of the MountainCar environment (e.g., acceleration limits, gravity, friction) as prior knowledge. The PINN uses a residual neural network to learn a state-to-action mapping while simultaneously enforcing physical consistency constraints during training via a loss term that penalizes violations of the known equations of motion. This ensures that actions are physically plausible and improves exploration efficiency by guiding the agent toward feasible trajectories. The policy head remains Gaussian, but the prior dynamics guide the policy to avoid impossible states, leading to faster convergence and higher mean rewards.",
