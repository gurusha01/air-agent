Specifically, the row player selects \"cooperate\" with probability 0.6 and \"defect\" with probability 0.4, based on the assumption that the column player has a moderate preference for coordination. This strategy balances the risk of misalignment while maintaining a consistent payoff through strategic uncertainty.",
