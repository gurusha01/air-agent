  "reflection": "1. **What approaches or techniques have worked best so far and why?**\n   - The approach that has performed the best so far is the use of **Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, achieving a score of 0.6925. DQNs effectively leverage deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function, allowing agents to learn complex policies directly from raw input data. This method's success can be attributed to its ability to handle high-dimensional state spaces and its capacity to learn through trial and error.\n\n2. **What has consistently failed or should be avoided?**\n   - Several approaches have failed or yielded suboptimal results. For instance, **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)**, both in their general form and specifically tailored versions like **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**, have not shown significant improvement over baseline scores. These methods often struggle with converging to optimal solutions due to their reliance on random mutations and selection pressures, which can lead to premature convergence or exploration issues. Additionally, **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**, when used to optimize move selection, did not yield substantial improvements compared to simpler strategies.\n\n3. **What specific, concrete direction should the next experiment try?**\n   - Given the promising results from DQNs, the next experiment should focus on refining and optimizing this approach further. Specifically, consider experimenting with different architectures, such as convolutio..."
