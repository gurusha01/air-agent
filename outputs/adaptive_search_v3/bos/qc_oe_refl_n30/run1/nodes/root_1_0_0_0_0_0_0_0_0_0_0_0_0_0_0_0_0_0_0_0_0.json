This indicates that combining RL with neural networks can effectively learn and adapt strategies in complex games like the Battle of Sexes. Additionally, **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**, when integrated with RL, has also yielded promising results, achieving a score of 0.6846.\n\n2. **Failed Approaches**: Several methods have consistently failed or underperformed. For instance, **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)**, including both traditional EA and genetic algorithms, have not produced satisfactory results. The scores obtained were either too low (e.g., 0.6805) or outright failures (e.g., \"FAIL\" for nodes `root_2` and `root_0_0_0`). This suggests that EA might not be the most suitable technique for optimizing strategies in this context.\n\n3. **Next Experiment Direction**: Given the promising results from RLNN and MCTS, the next experiment should focus on refining these techniques further. Specifically, consider implementing a hybrid approach that combines RLNN with MCTS, leveraging the strengths of both methods. This could involve integrating MCTS within the RL framework to improve exploration and exploitation trade-offs. Additionally, experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters for the neural networks could le..."
