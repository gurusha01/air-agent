  "strategy": "The row player implements a Bayesian updating strategy with a hierarchical prior on the column player's type. The column player is modeled as either a \"cooperative\" type (always cooperates) or a \"defecting\" type (always defects), with a prior belief of 50% each. After each round, the row player updates their belief using Bayes' rule based on the observed action. If the column player cooperated, the posterior probability of being cooperative increases; if they defected, it decreases. The row player then chooses \"Cooperate\" with probability equal to the posterior belief in the cooperative type. This strategy leverages adaptive belief formation and avoids overfitting to short-term patterns.",
