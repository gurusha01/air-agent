Specifically, if the column player has cooperated in the last two rounds, the row player plays \"cooperate\" with 70% probability; otherwise, they play \"dominate\" with 70% probability. This introduces temporal dependence and adaptive behavior, leveraging learning from past interactions to shift strategy.",
