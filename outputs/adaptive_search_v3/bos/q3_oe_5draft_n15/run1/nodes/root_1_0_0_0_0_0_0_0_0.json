  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the opponent's action probabilities, updating it after each observation using a Beta-binomial conjugate prior. The initial belief assumes equal probability (0.5) for both actions. After each round, the posterior is updated based on the opponent's action, and the row player selects the action that maximizes the expected payoff under the current belief. This approach uses probabilistic inference rather than reinforcement learning or frequency analysis, offering a fundamentally different mechanism for decision-making.",
