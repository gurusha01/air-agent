  "strategy": "Implement a moving average-based action prediction strategy where the row player computes a 7-round weighted moving average of the opponent's action choices, with higher weights assigned to more recent rounds (using a decaying exponential weighting: 0.2, 0.3, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1). If the predicted probability of the opponent choosing the same action exceeds 0.65, the row player switches to the complementary action with a probability of 0.75. Otherwise, it maintains the current action. This strategy uses temporal smoothing with non-uniform weighting to detect trends, distinct from frequency-based or threshold-based rules.",
