  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic threshold-based strategy where the row player monitors the opponent's action sequence and sets a time-varying threshold for deviation from the expected action. If the opponent's observed action deviates from the current posterior belief by more than a dynamically adjusted threshold (e.g., based on round number or variance of the belief), the row player switches to the action that has historically yielded higher payoff in such deviation events. This strategy introduces a rule-based trigger mechanism that reacts to anomalies rather than continuous belief updates, leveraging outlier detection principles.",
