  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic threshold-based policy that monitors the opponent's move frequency over the last 10 rounds. If the opponent chooses the same action in more than 60% of the recent rounds, the row player switches to the complementary action with a fixed probability of 0.8; otherwise, it continues with the previous action. The threshold is updated every 5 rounds using a sliding window. This strategy uses a simple rule-based system with adaptive thresholds, leveraging behavioral pattern detection rather than any learned model or temporal dynamics. No neural network or linear regression is involved.",
