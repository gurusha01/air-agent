  "strategy": "Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an LSTM layer to model the temporal dependencies in the column player's action history. Instead of using static lagged features, the RNN processes sequences of past actions (e.g., a window of 5 previous moves) to predict the expected payoff of cooperation or defection. The model is trained to output a score difference (payoff) between mutual cooperation and defection, with a reward structure of +1, -1, and -2 as before. The action is selected via a softmax-based policy derived from the RNN output, with exploration added via noise injection during training. This approach captures complex temporal patterns and non-linear dependencies that linear models miss.",
