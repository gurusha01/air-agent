  "strategy": "Switch to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on a sliding window of opponent actions, using normalized frequency counts of cooperation and defection over the last 3 turns as input features. Instead of entropy, incorporate a dynamic reward-weighted feature that penalizes repeated defection patterns. The row player cooperates only if the SVM predicts cooperation with a probability above 0.55, otherwise defects. This approach emphasizes linear decision boundaries and avoids non-parametric overfitting while capturing local frequency shifts through sparse feature representation.",
