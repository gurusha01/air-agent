  "strategy": "Apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer to model opponent action sequences as time-series data. Each action (cooperate/defect) is encoded as a binary vector, and the LSTM learns temporal dependencies to predict the opponent's next move. The row player cooperates if the LSTM's predicted probability of cooperation exceeds 0.65, with dynamic thresholding based on the variance of the predicted sequence. This approach captures temporal patterns beyond static topic modeling, such as anticipation of defection cycles or strategic shifts over time.",
