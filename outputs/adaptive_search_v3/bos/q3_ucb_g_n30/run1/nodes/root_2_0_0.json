  "strategy": "Adopt a dynamically adaptive strategy using real-time opponent response tracking: after each round, update the row player's choice probability based on the opponent's past two moves using a simple Bayesian update rule. If the opponent chooses column A in the last two rounds, increase the probability of choosing row A by 0.1; otherwise, maintain a base probability of 0.6. This strategy leverages feedback without relying on periodic cycles, shifting probabilities in response to observed behavior.",
