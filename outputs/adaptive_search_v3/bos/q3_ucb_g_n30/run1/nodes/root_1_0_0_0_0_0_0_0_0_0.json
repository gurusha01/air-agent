  "strategy": "Replace the Transformer with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes the move history as a 2D temporal-spatial grid, where each time step is a row and each action (cooperation/defection) is a channel. Apply spatial convolutions to detect recurring patterns such as cyclic behaviors or phase shifts in the column player\u2019s actions. Use a shared embedding for both players' actions and apply max-pooling across time to extract salient features. The model outputs a payoff difference score, and the row player selects cooperation if the score exceeds a dynamic threshold derived from the opponent\u2019s recent average payoff. This approach leverages local pattern recognition instead of long-range attention, making it more robust to noise in short-term dynamics.",
