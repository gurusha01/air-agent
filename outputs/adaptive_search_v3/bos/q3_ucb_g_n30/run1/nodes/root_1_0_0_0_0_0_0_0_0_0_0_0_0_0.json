  "strategy": "Introduce a random forest-based ensemble model that learns payoff predictions from discretized opponent action histograms. Instead of treating action pairs as continuous observations, group historical actions into bins (e.g., \"last 5 moves: mostly cooperate\", \"alternating patterns\") and use tree-based splits to estimate expected payoffs for cooperation vs. defection. The model captures non-linear interactions between action sequences without assuming a smooth latent surface. The row player selects cooperation if the tree ensemble predicts a higher expected payoff, with a dynamic pruning rule that reduces cooperation frequency when the model\u2019s out-of-bag uncertainty exceeds a threshold (set to 0.3). This strategy avoids kernel regression and parametric assumptions entirely, relying on ensemble-based decision boundaries.",
