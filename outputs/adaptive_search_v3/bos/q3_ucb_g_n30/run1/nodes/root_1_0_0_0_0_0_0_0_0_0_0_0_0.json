  "strategy": "Introduce a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian inference framework to model the row player's payoff as a non-parametric function of the opponent's historical actions. Instead of relying on deep neural networks, the model treats each action pair (cooperate/defect) as a noisy observation from a latent payoff surface, and uses kernel regression to predict the expected payoff of cooperation versus defection. The row player selects cooperation when the posterior mean of the cooperation payoff exceeds a dynamic threshold derived from the uncertainty of the current state\u2014higher uncertainty leads to more conservative choices. This approach avoids explicit sequence modeling and focuses on probabilistic inference over player behavior, making it fundamentally different from attention or LSTM-based methods.",
