  "strategy": "The row player implements a quantum-inspired state mixing strategy, where they maintain a probabilistic superposition of past column player actions over the last four rounds. Each state is weighted by a Gaussian decay function, and the current action is chosen based on the expected payoff of a linear combination of past actions, with the weights updated every three rounds using a momentum-adjusted Kalman filter. If the column player's action from three rounds ago was the same as their own, they coordinate (both choose \"Rock\") with 70% probability. Otherwise, they follow a payoff-maximizing solo move with 70% probability.",
