  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player learns a policy through trial and error, using a Q-learning framework with a state space defined by the opponent's last two moves and the current round number. The state transitions are updated after each interaction, and the row player selects the action (row A or row B) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward based on estimated Q-values. To prevent overfitting, a discount factor of 0.9 is applied, and exploration is governed by \u03b5-greedy with \u03b5 decaying exponentially over time. This approach treats the opponent as a dynamic agent with evolving behavior patterns, independent of fixed types or cycles.",
