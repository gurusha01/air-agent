  "strategy": "Introduce a Transformer-based attention mechanism that models the Battle of Sexes game as a sequential decision process with dynamic player-specific embeddings. Instead of relying on LSTM-based temporal modeling, the Transformer encodes move histories as a sequence of action pairs (cooperate/defect) from both players, using self-attention to identify salient temporal patterns such as shifts in cooperation frequency or asymmetric defection triggers. Each player's action is represented with a separate attention head, allowing the model to detect when one player's behavior deviates from expected patterns. The row player cooperates when the attention-weighted contextual payoff for cooperation exceeds a threshold derived from the relative importance of past cooperative interactions. This strategy leverages global dependencies across the entire history, unlike the local temporal modeling of RNNs.",
