  "strategy": "Introduce a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling approach to extract hidden behavioral patterns from opponent action sequences. Treat each historical interaction as a document where actions (cooperate/defect) are tokens, and use LDA to identify latent topics such as \"cooperative stability\", \"irregular defection\", or \"tactical alternation\". The row player then selects cooperation if the inferred topic distribution suggests a high probability of mutual cooperation (e.g., topic \"cooperative stability\" dominates), using a Bayesian posterior over topic weights. The decision threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the entropy of the topic mixture\u2014cooperation is favored when entropy is low and patterned behavior is detected.",
