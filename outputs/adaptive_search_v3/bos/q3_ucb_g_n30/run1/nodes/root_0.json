Specifically, if the column player chose the same action in the last two rounds, the row player plays the coordination action with 70% probability; otherwise, they shift to a solo move (e.g., choosing \"Rock\" when column chooses \"Paper\") with 70% probability. This introduces temporal dependence and exploits potential pattern recognition by the column player.",
