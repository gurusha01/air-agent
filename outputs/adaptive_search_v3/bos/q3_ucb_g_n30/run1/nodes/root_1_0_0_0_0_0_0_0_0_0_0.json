  "strategy": "Replace the CNN with a recurrent neural network (RNN) using a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architecture that processes the move history as a sequence of action pairs. Each timestep encodes the current and previous actions of both players, with separate LSTM branches tracking the row and column player's behavior. The hidden states are combined using a learned gating mechanism to detect asymmetric behavioral shifts (e.g., when the column player begins to defect after prolonged cooperation). The model outputs a contextual payoff prediction, and the row player cooperates if the predicted payoff is above a threshold that dynamically adjusts based on the opponent's current win-loss ratio. This strategy emphasizes temporal dynamics and asymmetry in behavioral evolution, contrasting with the spatial pattern detection in the CNN approach.",
