If the column player has cooperated in more than 2 out of the last 3 rounds, the row player responds with cooperation with 80% probability; otherwise, they defect with 80% probability. This strategy uses a simple behavioral pattern recognition based on the column player's consistency, aiming to exploit predictable tendencies without relying on reward history or temporal feedback.",
