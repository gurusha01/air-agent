  "strategy": "Implement a strategy using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer the column player's underlying state (e.g., \"cooperative\" or \"defective\") based on their action sequence. The HMM learns state transitions and emission probabilities over a 7-round observation window. If the posterior probability of the column player being in a \"cooperative\" state exceeds 0.4, the row player cooperates with 65% probability; otherwise, they defect with 75% probability. This approach models unobserved behavioral states and captures complex, non-linear patterns beyond simple autocorrelation.",
