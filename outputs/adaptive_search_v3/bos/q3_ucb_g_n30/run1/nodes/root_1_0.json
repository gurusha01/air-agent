  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player updates their action probabilities based on a reward signal derived from the column player's move history. Specifically, the row player tracks the cumulative payoff from each action (cooperate or defect) over the last 5 rounds and adjusts their choice to maximize expected reward. If the recent average payoff from cooperation exceeds that of defection, the row player cooperates with 70% probability; otherwise, they defect with 70% probability. This strategy leverages temporal reward feedback to learn optimal behavior dynamically.",
