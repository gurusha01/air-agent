  "strategy": "Apply a random forest classifier trained on lagged opponent action sequences, where each feature represents the frequency of cooperation/defection over the last 5 turns, along with a rolling window-based entropy measure. The model is trained to predict the opponent\u2019s next action, and the row player cooperates if the predicted probability of cooperation exceeds 0.60. This approach leverages non-parametric decision trees to capture complex, non-linear interactions without assuming temporal dynamics, unlike LSTM-based models. Feature engineering emphasizes local behavioral patterns rather than sequential dependencies.",
