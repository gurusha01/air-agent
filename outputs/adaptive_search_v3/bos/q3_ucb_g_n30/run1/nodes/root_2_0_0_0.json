  "strategy": "Apply a time-delayed feedback mechanism where the row player's choice probability is updated based on the opponent's move two rounds prior, but only if the opponent's move two rounds ago was different from their move one round ago. This introduces a lagged correlation filter that detects shifts in opponent behavior without immediate reaction. When such a shift is detected, the row player increases the probability of choosing row A by 0.15; otherwise, it remains at 0.6. This strategy uses temporal pattern detection instead of sequential consistency.",
