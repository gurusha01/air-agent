  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the opponent's type (e.g., cooperative vs. exploitative) based on observed moves. Each time the opponent chooses a strategy, the row player updates the posterior using Bayes' theorem with a prior belief of 50% cooperative and 50% exploitative. If the opponent's move aligns with a cooperative pattern (e.g., choosing column B consistently), the row player increases the probability of choosing row A to exploit the perceived altruism. Otherwise, it defaults to 0.6. This strategy uses a dynamic belief state and assumes opponent heterogeneity, which is fundamentally different from cyclical pattern modeling.",
