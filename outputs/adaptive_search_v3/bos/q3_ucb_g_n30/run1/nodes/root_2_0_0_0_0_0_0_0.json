  "strategy": "Apply a Markov Chain-based transition modeling strategy where the row player predicts the opponent's move probabilities based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that tracks the opponent's move history with emission probabilities for actions A and B. The row player computes the most likely hidden state (e.g., \"cooperative,\" \"defensive\") and selects action A if the posterior probability of the opponent choosing B is below 0.4, otherwise selects B. This approach assumes the opponent follows a probabilistic, memory-limited pattern with latent states, and the row player adapts dynamically to state transitions using a Viterbi-like inference process.",
