The row player uses the final hidden state of the LSTM to compute a real-valued confidence score for defect tendency; if this score is below 0.4, the row player chooses cooperation with 70% probability. This approach captures temporal dependencies through deep learning without relying on predefined state categories or transition matrices.",

The best-performing approach so far is the GRU-based RNN with a sequence of the opponent\u2019s last five actions (root_1_0_0_0: 1.4340), which outperforms all alternatives by leveraging temporal dynamics through recurrent memory. This is followed by the LSTM-based RNN (root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0: 1.3740) and the Transformer encoder (root_1_0_0_0_1: 1.3648), suggesting that modeling opponent behavior as a time-series with memory or attention mechanisms is effective\u2014especially when sequence length is preserved and state representation is rich.  \n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include HMMs with first-order transitions (root_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 0.9385), which underperform despite their theoretical appeal, likely due to poor state discretization or inability to capture complex temporal dependencies. Similarly, quantum-inspired or chaotic map strategies (e.g., logistic map, root_2_0_0_0_0_0: 1.0785) and Bayesian Neural Networks with hierarchical priors (root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0: 0.7960) show low scores, indicating they fail to generalize or overcomplicate the model without sufficient data.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand from root_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 (0.9385) by replacing the HMM with a **GRU-based RNN that uses the opponent\u2019s last five actions as a sequence input**, but with **dilated convolutions applied to the input sequence before feeding into the GRU** to better capture long-range dependencies. This combines the strengths of bot..."
