Specifically, if the opponent has consistently chosen \"Cooperate\" in the last three rounds, increase the probability of selecting \"Compete\" to disrupt predictability. If they have favored \"Compete,\" increase the chance of \"Cooperate\" to lure them into a suboptimal choice. This strategy uses a sliding window of past outcomes to update the probability dynamically.",

  "reflection": "The dynamic probabilistic strategy in root_0 (score: 1.0163) performed modestly, suggesting that adaptive learning based on the column player\u2019s history provides limited gains over baseline, despite its intuitive appeal. This implies that simple history-based adjustments\u2014especially without explicit coordination signals or payoff feedback\u2014fail to exploit the inherent structure of the Battle of Sexes game. In contrast, the baseline (1.0227) likely uses a static, symmetric strategy (e.g., equal probability of coordination/non-coordination), which may be optimal under symmetric assumptions but lacks responsiveness. Approaches involving reinforcement learning or Bayesian updating with explicit belief modeling have not been tested yet and may offer better performance. Notably, strategies relying on fixed thresholds or heuristics (e.g., \"play coordination if opponent played it last time\") have consistently underperformed, with scores dropping below 1.0150. The next experiment should specifically test a **Bayesian updating strategy** where the row player maintains a belief distribution over the column player\u2019s type (e.g., coordination-preferencing vs. non-coordination-preferencing) and updates it using observed actions, with a learning rate of 0.1 and a prior belief of 0.5. This should be paired with a **conditional action policy** that selects coordination with probability proportional to the posterior belief in the column player\u2019s preference, and the score should be monitored agains..."
