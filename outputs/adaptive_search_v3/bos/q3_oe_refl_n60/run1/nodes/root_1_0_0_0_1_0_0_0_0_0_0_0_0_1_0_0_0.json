  "strategy": "Apply a Reinforcement Learning with Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR+) framework to learn the opponent's strategy over time. Instead of modeling the opponent's actions as a Gaussian process, we treat the interaction as a sequential game where the row player updates its policy based on counterfactual regret, accumulating regrets over past outcomes and adjusting action selection to minimize long-term regret. The policy is updated incrementally after each round, with exploration governed by an epsilon-greedy mechanism that decays logarithmically. Feature engineering focuses on action co-occurrence patterns and payoff deviations from expected values, using a sliding window of the last 5 rounds to compute conditional probabilities. This approach replaces probabilistic belief modeling with a learning-based policy refinement mechanism, fundamentally differing from Gaussian process modeling.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing strategies so far are **Markov Chain-based modeling** (score: 1.4390) and **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** with kernel-based belief updates (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 1.3991), which outperform RNNs and Transformers in capturing opponent dynamics with fewer parameters and better uncertainty handling. These models work well because they explicitly model transition probabilities or probabilistic distributions over actions, allowing for robust inference even with limited data.\n\n2. Approaches that consistently fail or should be avoided include **Transformer-based models with self-attention over raw action sequences** when applied without proper positional encoding or contextual constraints (e.g., root_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 0.3191, 0.3187), which suffer from overfitting, vanishing gradients, or ill-defined state representations. Additionally, **deep DRL frameworks with shallow or unstructured architectures** (e.g., root_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 0.3187) fail due to poor generalization and instability in training. The **HMMs with complex latent states** (e.g., root_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 0.7405) also underperform due to overparameterization and sensitivity to initialization.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the Gaussian Process Belief Model** from root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0 (score: 0.6159) by introducing **a kernel that explicitly captures temporal autocorrelation** (e.g., a Mat\u00e9rn kernel with \u03bd=1.5) and **..."
