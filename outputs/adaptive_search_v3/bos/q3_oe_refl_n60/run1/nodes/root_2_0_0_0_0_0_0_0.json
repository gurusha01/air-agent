  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the GRU-based RNN in **root_1_0_0_0** (score: 1.4340), which leverages a sequence of the opponent\u2019s last five actions as input to model behavioral dynamics. This outperforms alternatives like Transformers (1.2556\u20131.3648) and TCNs (1.2556), suggesting that simpler recurrent models with direct temporal memory are more effective than complex architectures like self-attention or dilated convolutions in this setting. The success likely stems from the GRU\u2019s ability to efficiently capture short- to medium-term dependencies without overfitting or requiring complex positional encoding.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include **Transformer-based models** (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_1: 1.3648, root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0: 1.2725) and **Bayesian Neural Networks** (root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0: 0.7960), which either overcomplicate the model or introduce instability due to uncertainty quantification. Similarly, **quantum-inspired** and **chaotic map-based** strategies (e.g., root_2_0_0_0_0: 1.0785, root_2_0_0_0_0_0: 1.0800) yield scores below 1.10 and lack clear empirical justification, indicating they are not capturing exploitable patterns. The **failed node root_1_0_0_0_0** (FAIL) also highlights that improper sequence modeling\u2014such as treating actions as raw tokens without proper embedding or context\u2014leads to breakdowns.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_2_0_0_0_0_0_0** (score: 1.0986) by introducing **a GRU layer w..."
