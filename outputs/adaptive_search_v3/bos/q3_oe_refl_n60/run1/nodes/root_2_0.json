  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is the GRU-based RNN with a sequence of the opponent\u2019s last five actions (root_1_0_0_0: 1.4340), which outperforms all alternatives by nearly 0.4 in score. This success stems from the GRU\u2019s ability to effectively capture short- to medium-term temporal dependencies in opponent behavior without overfitting, while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, approaches like the Transformer encoder (root_1_0_0_0_1: 1.3648) and TCN (root_1_0_0_0_1_0: 1.2556) underperform, likely due to overcomplicating the model or poor handling of sparse, sequential action patterns. The Bayesian Neural Network (root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0: 0.7960) and decision tree regressor (root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 0.5974) fail due to poor generalization and high variance in uncertainty modeling or feature encoding. The next experiment should expand from **root_2** (0.6835), a simple mixed strategy with fixed probability (0.6 to cooperate), and instead **introduce a dynamic probability adjustment using a small GRU to predict opponent action patterns from the last three actions**, with a state input of opponent\u2019s last three actions (one-hot encoded) and a policy output that adjusts cooperation probability based on predicted action trends. This combines the proven strength of GRUs in modeling opponent dynamics with a more adaptive, data-driven strategy, directly addressing the weakness of static mixed strategies."
