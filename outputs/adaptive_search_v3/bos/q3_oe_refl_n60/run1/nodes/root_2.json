  "reflection": "The dynamic probabilistic strategy in **root_0** (score: 1.0163) outperformed the baseline (1.0227) only slightly, suggesting that while adaptive behavior based on history improves coordination, it still falls short of the baseline. This implies that simple history-based adjustments may not capture the full dynamics of the Battle of Sexes, especially when the column player's actions are unpredictable or non-revealing. In contrast, **root_1** (score: 0.7100) \u2014 a dynamic mixed strategy with probabilistic randomization \u2014 failed dramatically, indicating that randomization without adaptive learning or coordination signals is ineffective. The consistent failure of strategies relying on static or poorly tuned probability adjustments (e.g., fixed or slowly decaying weights) suggests that such approaches lack responsiveness to real-time behavioral patterns. The best-performing strategy so far uses a simple M (likely a moving average or Markov-based update) to adjust the row player\u2019s choice based on observed column player history, which implies that **temporal pattern recognition** and **adaptive thresholding** are key. The next experiment should specifically test a **reinforcement learning (RL) policy** with a Q-learning agent that updates its action probabilities using a 3-step history window, with a learning rate of 0.1 and discount factor of 0.9, to better capture the value of coordination vs. non-coordination over time. This approach directly builds on the success of root_0\u2019s dyna..."
