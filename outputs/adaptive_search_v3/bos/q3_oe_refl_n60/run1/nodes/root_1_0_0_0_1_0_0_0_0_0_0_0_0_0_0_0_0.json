  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based RNN with a Transformer architecture, using self-attention mechanisms to model long-term dependencies in opponent actions. Instead of relying on sequential encoding of the last four actions, the state representation now includes attention-weighted aggregates over a sliding window of 8 past actions, allowing the model to dynamically focus on relevant patterns (e.g., repeated sequences or sudden shifts). The Q-value function is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a clip ratio of 0.2 and a learning rate of 0.001, and actions are selected using an adaptive temperature that decreases over time to reduce exploration after convergence. This approach captures non-linear, context-sensitive opponent behaviors more effectively than sequential RNNs.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategies so far are **Markov Chain-based modeling** (score: 1.4390) and **GRU-based RNNs** (score: 1.4340), which outperform all others by leveraging sequential dependencies in opponent behavior through probabilistic transitions or recurrent state representations. These models succeed because they explicitly model temporal dynamics\u2014such as first-order Markov transitions or hidden state evolution\u2014without overfitting to noise, and they generalize well across diverse opponent patterns. In contrast, approaches like **Gaussian Process Regression** (1.0986), **Hidden Markov Models** (0.9385, 0.8855), and **Bayesian Neural Networks** (0.7960) consistently underperform, likely due to high variance in predictions, poor scalability, or overcomplication without clear signal in the data. The **Transformer-based models** (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 1.3648) show promise but degrade when applied to short sequences (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 1.0215), suggesting that self-attention over long sequences is inefficient or unstable in this context.  \n\nFor the next experiment, we should **refine the GRU-based RNN** from **root_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0** (score: 1.0215) by introducing **a dynamic attention mechanism over the last 3 actions** (not just raw history), using a lightweight attention layer to weigh the influence of recent actions, and applying **a dropout rate of 0.3** to prevent overfitting. We should also **add a gating mech..."
