  "reflection": "The randomized alternating strategy in **root_0** (score: 1.1606) has outperformed all others, demonstrating that structured, periodic alternation\u2014specifically a 3-round cycle with a 0.6/0.4 probability of A/B\u2014effectively exploits the asymmetry in the Battle of Sexes game by making the opponent's prediction harder. This suggests that *temporal patterns* and *non-stationary behavior* are more effective than static mixed strategies. In contrast, **root_1** (score: 1.0725), which uses a logistic-based probability adjustment, underperforms, indicating that adaptive, opponent-responsive mixing fails due to insufficient learning dynamics or poor parameter calibration (e.g., logistic slope or threshold). Consistently failing approaches include overly complex or continuous probability functions that lack clear periodicity or exploitability. The next experiment should test a **modified alternating strategy with dynamic probability shifts**\u2014specifically, a 3-round cycle where the row player increases the probability of Action A from 0.6 to 0.7 after every two rounds (e.g., A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B \u2192 0.6, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.6, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, ...), with a learning rate of 0.1 and a minimum probability floor of 0.4, to balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining pattern predictability. This builds on root_0\u2019s success while introducing controlled variation to test if dynamic adjustment improves score beyond 1.1606."
