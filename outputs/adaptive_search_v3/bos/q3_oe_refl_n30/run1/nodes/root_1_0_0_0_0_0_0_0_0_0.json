Instead of using self-attention, the LSTM captures temporal dependencies through internal memory cells, enabling the model to remember past actions and their payoffs over time. The output layer computes a weighted average of past payoffs based on the LSTM's hidden state relevance, with exploration introduced via a time-dependent noise injection into the hidden state updates, rather than attention weights. This approach emphasizes memory dynamics over attention mechanisms and avoids reliance on tokenization of actions.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the **randomized alternating strategy** at root_0 with a score of **1.1606**, significantly outperforming all others. This success likely stems from its simplicity and effectiveness in exploiting the inherent symmetry and coordination incentives in the Battle of Sexes game\u2014by alternating patterns, it introduces unpredictability while maintaining a consistent bias toward Action A (60% probability), which may align well with the opponent\u2019s behavioral tendencies. In contrast, complex models like **Transformers**, **GNNs**, and **LSTMs** (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0: 1.0773) have consistently underperformed, suggesting that deep sequential modeling or contextual feature encoding adds unnecessary complexity without sufficient payoff. These models fail to generalize well in a small, symmetric game where coordination and simple heuristics dominate. The **Bayesian belief updating** (root_1_0_0: 1.0740) and **AR(1) time-series** (root_1_0: 1.0784) strategies perform modestly, indicating that dynamic belief modeling or autoregressive patterns are insufficient without strong prior assumptions or opponent-specific structure. The next experiment should **refine the alternating strategy by introducing a small, adaptive bias**\u2014specifically, adjusting the probability of Action A from 0.6 to 0.6 + 0.05\u00d7(round number mod 3) to create a subtle, periodic shift every 3 rounds\u2014while keeping the alternating pattern intact. This maintains the core structure of..."
