Instead of processing sequences linearly, the Transformer captures long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between past actions (e.g., detecting patterns like alternating choices or cycles in Top/Bottom or Left/Right moves). The model takes a fixed-length sequence of past action pairs as input and outputs a contextualized expected payoff for each action. The row player selects the action with the highest predicted payoff, with exploration managed via a decaying softmax policy that introduces random action selection with a small probability. This approach fundamentally shifts from sequential recurrence to parallel attention-based learning, enabling better detection of hidden patterns in opponent behavior.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the **randomized alternating strategy** (root_0: 1.1606), which outperforms all others by nearly 14% relative gain over the baseline (1.0227). This success likely stems from its ability to exploit predictable opponent patterns through structured alternation, even with probabilistic choices (0.6 A, 0.4 B), creating a non-repeating but exploitable rhythm. In contrast, approaches like **time-series autoregressive (AR(1))**, **\u03b5-greedy RL**, and **Bayesian belief updating** (root_1_0_0) underperform, with scores peaking at 1.0784 and 1.0740 respectively\u2014indicating they fail to capture the strategic depth of coordination in the Battle of Sexes. Notably, **RNN/LSTM** (root_1_0_0_0_0_0: 1.0734) and **contextual bandits** (1.0813) show only marginal gains, suggesting that complex models with rich feature encodings do not generalize well without strong signal or sufficient training data. The **mixed strategy with logistic function** (root_1: 1.0725) and **time-dependent probabilistic strategies** (root_0_0: 0.7249) are particularly weak, with the latter failing catastrophically, likely due to poor adaptation or overfitting to noise. The next experiment should **refine the alternating strategy** by introducing **dynamic probability modulation**\u2014specifically, adjusting the 0.6/0.4 A/B ratio based on the opponent\u2019s recent action history (e.g., increase A probability after opponent chooses B), using a simple rule like: *if opponent played B in the la..."
