Specifically, for each round, the feature vector is constructed as: (opponent's last action, row player's last action, number of times opponent chose Top in last 3 rounds, row player's average payoff when choosing Right vs. Left). A linear model is trained on historical data to predict the expected payoff for each action pair. The row player then selects the action with the highest predicted payoff, using a Thompson sampling approach to balance exploration and exploitation. This method incorporates temporal context and behavioral trends without relying on direct payoff history or frequency counts.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the **randomized alternating strategy** at *root_0* with a score of **1.1606**, significantly outperforming all others\u2014this suggests that structured, predictable alternation (even with probabilistic elements) can exploit the inherent coordination dynamics of the Battle of Sexes game, where players benefit from mutual coordination but face a conflict of interest. In contrast, approaches like *Bayesian belief updating* (root_1_0_0, score 1.0740) and *AR(1) autoregressive models* (root_1_0, score 1.0784) fail to capture the strategic asymmetry or the need for coordinated action, resulting in scores only marginally above baseline. The *reinforcement learning with \u03b5-greedy* strategy (root_1_0_0_0, score 1.0776) shows promise but still lags behind due to insufficient exploration of coordination patterns and poor handling of the opponent\u2019s mixed strategy. A key failure is the *time-dependent probabilistic strategy* (root_0_0, score 0.7249), which collapses performance due to overfitting to short-term feedback without accounting for the game\u2019s structural incentives. The next experiment should expand on the *\u03b5-greedy RL* strategy by introducing **explicit coordination rewards**\u2014for instance, modifying the reward function to assign higher rewards when both players choose the same action (e.g., both A or both B), and tuning the exploration rate (\u03b5) to **0.1** to balance exploitation of observed patterns with sufficient exploration of coordination o..."
