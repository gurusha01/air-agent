  "strategy": "Introduce a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with observable action sequences and latent state transitions, where each hidden state represents the opponent's behavioral pattern (e.g., cooperative, exploitative, random). The model infers the current state using the Viterbi algorithm, and the row player's action is selected based on a state-dependent payoff matrix derived from historical interactions. The HMM updates its transition probabilities using a smoothed maximum-likelihood estimator, and exploration is introduced via a fixed entropy-regularized policy that encourages sampling from less-visited states. This approach leverages probabilistic state inference rather than neural memory dynamics.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the randomized alternating strategy at **root_0** with a score of **1.1606**, significantly outperforming all others. This approach leverages simple, structured alternation (A-B-A-B...) combined with a probabilistic mix (0.6 A, 0.4 B), likely exploiting the opponent\u2019s limited ability to predict or adapt to periodic patterns. In contrast, complex models like GNNs, Transformers, and RNNs (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with score 1.0762) fail to deliver gains despite their sophistication\u2014suggesting that overfitting to historical data or overcomplicating dynamics is counterproductive. Notably, strategies relying on contextual bandits or Bayesian belief updating (e.g., root_1_0_0_0 with 1.0776) show modest improvements but do not surpass the baseline, indicating that dynamic feature engineering or belief updating alone is insufficient. The consistent failure of deep learning models (especially Transformers and GNNs) with scores below 1.08 suggests that they lack interpretability, generalization, or alignment with the game\u2019s inherent structure. The next experiment should specifically expand the **RNN-LSTM** variant at **root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0** (score: 1.0762) by introducing a **time-windowed attention mechanism** that focuses on the last 3 rounds of opponent actions and the row player\u2019s own history, using a **learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 128**, to better capture short-term dependencies without overfitting.
