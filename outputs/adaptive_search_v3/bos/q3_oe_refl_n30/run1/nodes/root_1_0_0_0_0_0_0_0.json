Exploration is controlled via a temperature-scaled epsilon-greedy policy, with the temperature decaying logarithmically over time to balance exploration and exploitation.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the **randomized alternating strategy** (root_0: 1.1606), which outperforms all others by nearly 14% above the baseline. This success likely stems from its simplicity and effectiveness in exploiting the inherent symmetry and predictability in the Battle of Sexes game\u2014by introducing a structured, non-repeating pattern (A-B-A-B...) that the opponent cannot easily exploit or anticipate. In contrast, complex models like **LSTM-based RNNs** (root_1_0_0_0_0_0) and **Transformer architectures** (root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0) yield only modest gains (1.0752), suggesting that deep sequential modeling overfits or fails to capture the game\u2019s low-dimensional, strategic dynamics. These advanced models also introduce unnecessary complexity and computational overhead without meaningful performance gains.  \n\nStrategies involving **contextual bandits** (root_1_0_0_0_0: 1.0813) or **Bayesian belief updating** (root_1_0_0: 1.0740) show promise but still fall short of the alternating strategy, indicating that dynamic feature engineering or belief updating alone is insufficient. The **time-series autoregressive (AR(1))** and **\u03b5-greedy RL** approaches (root_1_0: 1.0784, root_1_0_0_0: 1.0776) also fail to surpass the baseline, likely due to their reliance on historical opponent actions without accounting for coordination incentives.  \n\nThe next experiment should **refine the alternating strategy by introducing adaptive probability modulation**\u2014specifically, adjusting t..."
