  "strategy": "Adopt a reinforcement learning with exploration-exploitation (\u03b5-greedy) strategy where the row player maintains a reward history for each pair of actions (Top/Left, Top/Right, Bottom/Left, Bottom/Right). After each round, the row player updates the expected payoff for each action pair based on past outcomes. The row player then selects 'Right' with probability equal to the proportion of past rounds where the opponent chose 'Top' and the row player received a higher payoff in 'Right' compared to 'Left'. This approach relies on direct payoff feedback and action-frequency learning, distinct from Bayesian belief updating.",

  "reflection": "The randomized alternating strategy at **root_0** (score: 1.1606) has been the most successful, outperforming all others by over 10% relative gain, suggesting that introducing structured, predictable alternation\u2014specifically a periodic pattern with a 0.6/0.4 probability mix\u2014effectively exploits opponent behavioral patterns or biases in coordination. This outperformance implies that simple, non-randomized, periodic strategies with clear probabilistic structure are more effective than complex models like AR(1) or Bayesian updating, which failed to surpass the baseline. In contrast, strategies like the **Bayesian belief updating** (root_1_0_0: 1.0740) and **time-series autoregressive** (root_1_0: 1.0784) consistently underperform, likely because they assume opponent rationality or memory that doesn\u2019t hold in the Battle of Sexes, where coordination is often driven by social preferences, not sequential prediction. The **mixed strategy with logistic function** (root_1: 1.0725) and **time-dependent probabilistic** (root_0_0: 0.7249) also failed, with the latter showing a sharp drop in score, indicating that dynamic adjustments based on round count may introduce instability or noise. The next experiment should specifically expand on **root_1_0_0** by modifying the Bayesian updating to incorporate a **non-uniform prior** (e.g., favoring the opponent\u2019s previous action with a 0.7 prior weight) and using a **higher learning rate** (e.g., 0.1 vs. 0.01) to accelerate belief convergence, te..."
