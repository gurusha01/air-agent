  "strategy": "Implement a meta-learned strategy using a transformer-based policy network where the row player models the opponent\u2019s action sequence as a time-series and predicts future moves via autoregressive attention. The model is trained on historical interaction data to learn a latent representation of opponent dynamics, and during inference, it dynamically adjusts its action selection based on the predicted next move with a confidence score. High confidence in prediction triggers a coordinated action (e.g., matching), while low confidence induces randomization to maintain unpredictability. This approach replaces static clustering with a sequence-aware, attention-driven model that captures temporal dependencies in opponent behavior.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the **randomized alternating strategy** at root_0 with a score of **1.1606**, significantly outperforming all others\u2014over 10% above the baseline (1.0227). This success likely stems from its simplicity and effectiveness in exploiting the inherent unpredictability of the Battle of Sexes game, where alternating patterns can mislead the opponent into inconsistent responses. In contrast, complex models like HMMs (1.0794), GNNs (1.0740), and RNNs (1.0734\u20131.0764) consistently underperform, suggesting that deep sequential modeling or hidden state assumptions introduce unnecessary complexity without payoff. These models fail to generalize well in a game with limited information and no clear long-term patterns. The **Transformer-based sequence model** (root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0) scored 1.0773, showing marginal gains over simpler baselines, but still falls short of the alternating strategy. The next experiment should **refine the alternating strategy by introducing adaptive probability modulation**\u2014specifically, adjusting the 0.6/0.4 A/B probability based on the opponent\u2019s recent action history (e.g., increase A probability after opponent chooses B), using a simple logistic regression on lagged opponent actions with a learning rate of 0.01 and a window of 3 rounds. This maintains the core alternating structure while adding contextual responsiveness, potentially pushing the score beyond 1.1606."
