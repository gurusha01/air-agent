  "reflection": "The logistic regression-based mixed strategy in **root_1** (score: 1.1799) has outperformed all others, indicating that adaptive, data-driven probability assignments\u2014specifically using historical outcomes as features\u2014effectively capture the underlying preferences and coordination dynamics in the Battle of Sexes. This success suggests that modeling player behavior with observable features (e.g., past choices, opponent signals, timing) and using probabilistic responses improves score by enabling better anticipation of partner preferences. In contrast, **root_0** (score: 0.9402), which uses a fixed mixed strategy with static probabilities (0.6 for Coordination, 0.4 for Conflict), fails because it lacks adaptability and fails to respond to real-time behavioral patterns. Fixed strategies without feature input or learning fail to exploit coordination opportunities. The next experiment should expand from the root node by implementing a **logistic regression model** where the row player\u2019s choice probability is based on features such as *opponent\u2019s previous choice*, *time of interaction*, and *historical payoff patterns*\u2014specifically using a model trained on data where features are normalized and the logistic function is tuned with L2 regularization (\u03bb=0.1) and a learning rate of 0.01. This builds directly on root_1\u2019s success while adding more granular, observable features to improve generalization and score beyond 1.1799."
