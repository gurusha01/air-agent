  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far is the logistic regression-based mixed strategy in **root_1** (score: 1.1799), which outperforms all others by over 15% relative gain. This approach works because it leverages historical features\u2014such as opponent\u2019s past choices, round number, and time-of-day\u2014to compute a probabilistic mix between \"Movie\" and \"Sports\" that aligns with the game\u2019s equilibrium, effectively capturing coordination incentives. In contrast, approaches like reinforcement learning (**root_1_0**, score: 1.0178) and time-varying sine-based strategies (**root_2**, score: 0.8443) fail due to poor convergence, lack of feature grounding, or overfitting to short-term patterns. The RNN-based temporal predictor (**root_1_0_0**, score: 0.5984) consistently underperforms, likely because it overcomplicates a simple coordination game with insufficient temporal dynamics or signal-to-noise ratio in opponent behavior. The **root_0** strategy (score: 0.9402) using simulated annealing to choose between \"Coordination\" and \"Conflict\" is a baseline that fails to exploit the game\u2019s structure, as it ignores the strategic interdependence between actions. The next experiment should expand **root_0** by replacing the simulated annealing with a logistic regression model that uses features like opponent\u2019s last choice, round number, and a lagged feature (e.g., \"opponent chose Movie in previous 2 rounds\") to predict the probability of selecting \"Coordination\" or \"Conflict,\" with a regularization ..."
