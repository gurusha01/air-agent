  "strategy": "Implement a strategy using a time-series forecasting model (specifically a simple ARIMA-based prediction) to anticipate the opponent's next move based on their last five actions. The row player then selects Action A if the predicted probability of the opponent choosing Action B is above 0.6, otherwise selects Action B. This approach leverages temporal dependencies in opponent behavior without relying on reinforcement learning or explicit payoff updates. The strategy is trained on historical data from prior rounds and adjusted dynamically with a rolling window of 50 observations.",
