  "strategy": "Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to model opponent behavior over time. Instead of one-hot encoding lagged actions, encode the sequence of opponent actions (Action A or B) over the last 10 rounds as a time series input, where each time step represents a round. The LSTM learns temporal dependencies and patterns in opponent behavior, such as alternation or cycles. After training on historical rounds, the model outputs a probability that the opponent will choose Action B. If the predicted probability is below 0.45, the row player chooses Action A; otherwise, Action B. This approach captures sequential dynamics and memory in opponent choices, unlike the static feature-based model.",
