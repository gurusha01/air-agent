  "strategy": "Implement a strategy based on adaptive reinforcement learning where the row player updates the probability of choosing Action A or B using a Q-learning framework, with rewards derived from the payoff matrix and a decaying exploration rate. The strategy learns over time by adjusting the action selection based on observed opponent moves and the resulting payoffs, with a focus on maximizing cumulative rewards. The probability of choosing Action A is dynamically adjusted using a sigmoid function of the opponent's last three moves, normalized by a moving average of their past action frequencies.",
