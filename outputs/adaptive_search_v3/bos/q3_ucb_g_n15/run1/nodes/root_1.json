  "strategy": "Adopt a dynamic payoff-weighted strategy where the row player adjusts their choice (Cooperate or Defect) based on the historical correlation between the column player's past actions and the row player's payoff. Specifically, if the column player tends to choose 'High' when the row player previously chose 'Low', the row player increases the probability of choosing 'High' in response. This leverages temporal pattern recognition and assumes the column player has limited adaptability.",
