  "strategy": "Use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to model the opponent's behavior, where the input consists of a sequence of opponent actions over the last 10 rounds, encoded as one-hot vectors. Instead of using lagged actions directly, the LSTM learns temporal dependencies through recurrent connections. The model outputs a probability that the opponent will choose Action B. If this probability exceeds 0.58, the row player chooses Action A; otherwise, Action B. This approach captures sequential dynamics more effectively than traditional lagged features and introduces memory-based adaptation without relying on static feature engineering.",
