The model outputs a prediction probability of opponent choosing Action B. If the probability is below 0.45, the row player chooses Action A; otherwise, Action B. This approach leverages ensemble learning to capture non-linear patterns in opponent behavior without relying on temporal recurrence or sequence modeling, using only tree-based splits on discrete features.",
