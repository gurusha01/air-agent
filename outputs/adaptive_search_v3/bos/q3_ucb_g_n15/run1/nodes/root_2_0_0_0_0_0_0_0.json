  "strategy": "Use a Transformer-based model with self-attention mechanisms to encode the sequence of opponent actions over the last 10 rounds. Instead of relying on sequential LSTM dynamics, the Transformer captures long-range dependencies and complex co-occurrence patterns across rounds. Each round's action (A or B) is embedded into a vector, and the model computes attention weights across all past actions to predict the opponent\u2019s next choice. If the predicted probability of opponent choosing Action B exceeds 0.55, the row player selects Action A; otherwise, Action B. This approach leverages parallel processing and contextual understanding of opponent behavior, avoiding sequential memory biases.",
