  "strategy": "Apply a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to model the opponent's action sequence as a time-series signal. Instead of using discrete hidden states, the LSTM learns continuous latent representations of the opponent's behavioral dynamics by processing past action pairs (e.g., (A,B), (B,A)) as input sequences. The output is a real-valued score predicting the likelihood that the opponent will choose Action B in the next round. If the predicted probability of Action B is below 0.45, the row player selects Action A. This strategy captures complex, non-linear dependencies and contextual shifts that HMMs may miss due to their reliance on predefined state structures.",
