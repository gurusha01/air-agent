  "strategy": "Use a Random Forest classifier trained on historical opponent action sequences (last 10 rounds), where each feature represents the frequency of specific action patterns (e.g., \"opponent chose B after A in the previous round\", \"alternating AB pattern in last 3 rounds\"). The model outputs a probability of opponent choosing Action B. If this probability exceeds 0.58, row player selects Action A; otherwise, Action B. This strategy relies on ensemble learning and non-parametric pattern recognition, avoiding deep learning dependencies and focusing on interpretable, rule-based feature interactions.",
