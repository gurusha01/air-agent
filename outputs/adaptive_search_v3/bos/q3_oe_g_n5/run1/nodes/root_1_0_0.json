  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the opponent's preference (e.g., probability they prefer 'cooperate' or 'defect') and updates it using observed actions and payoffs via Bayes' rule. The strategy uses a conjugate prior (Beta distribution) to model the opponent's preference, with a prior centered at 0.5. After each round, the posterior is updated based on the observed outcome, and the row player chooses 'cooperate' with probability equal to the posterior belief that the opponent prefers cooperation. This approach captures long-term uncertainty in opponent behavior and avoids over-reliance on immediate rewards.",
