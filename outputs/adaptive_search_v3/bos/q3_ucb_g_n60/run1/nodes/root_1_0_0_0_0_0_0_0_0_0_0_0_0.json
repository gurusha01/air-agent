  "strategy": "Use a Transformer-based model with self-attention mechanisms to encode the sequence of column player actions, where each action is represented as a token with embedded payoff and action type. Instead of relying on a hidden state from a sequential RNN, the model computes attention weights over past rounds to dynamically assess the column player\u2019s behavioral patterns. The row player chooses \"Coordination\" if the attention weight on the most recent round exceeds a threshold derived from the median of all attention scores over the last 10 rounds. This strategy emphasizes pattern recognition through global context rather than sequential state evolution.",
