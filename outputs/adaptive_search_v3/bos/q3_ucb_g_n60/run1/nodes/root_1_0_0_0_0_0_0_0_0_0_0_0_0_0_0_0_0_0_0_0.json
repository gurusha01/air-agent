Instead of using raw action histories, engineer features such as the absolute difference in payoff between coordination and non-coordination, lagged payoff trends, and interaction terms between row and column player's past actions. The model is trained to prioritize high-payoff coordination patterns when the interaction term exceeds a threshold. The row player selects \"Coordination\" when the XGBoost prediction probability exceeds 0.72, with early stopping to prevent overfitting on noisy short-term dynamics.",
