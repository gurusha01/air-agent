  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based model with a Transformer-based architecture that processes opponent actions as a sequence of tokens, using self-attention to capture long-range dependencies in the opponent\u2019s behavior. Instead of relying on hidden states, the model learns a joint representation of action patterns through cross-attention between the row player\u2019s past actions and the opponent\u2019s historical moves. The attention weights are used to dynamically assign importance to specific time steps, and the predicted action is selected based on the top-1 action from a softmax output. This approach enables the model to detect subtle, non-linear behavioral shifts (e.g., alternating patterns or sudden deviations) that LSTM might miss due to its sequential processing bias.",
