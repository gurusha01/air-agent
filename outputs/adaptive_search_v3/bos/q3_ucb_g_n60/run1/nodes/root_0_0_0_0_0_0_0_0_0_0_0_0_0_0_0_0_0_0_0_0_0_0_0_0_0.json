  "strategy": "Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a LSTM layer to model opponent behavior, where the state comprises the opponent's last two actions and the current round modulo 4. The model predicts the expected payoff for each action based on the sequence of past actions, using a sliding window of length 2. During training, the model is updated using online gradient descent with a forgetting factor applied to older inputs. The action selection is probabilistic, derived from the predicted value differences, with a small epsilon-greedy exploration component. This approach captures temporal dependencies in opponent strategies through sequential learning, unlike static contextual bandits.",
