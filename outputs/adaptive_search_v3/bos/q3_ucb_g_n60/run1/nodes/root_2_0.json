If the temperature is above 25\u00b0C, they choose \"sports\" with 75% probability; otherwise, they choose \"movie\" with 75% probability. This leverages the fact that warmer weather tends to increase outdoor activity preferences, creating a physical environmental signal that correlates with behavioral tendencies in couples.",
