  "strategy": "Introduce a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model that learns the joint payoff landscape of the Battle of Sexes by modeling the probability of coordination as a non-parametric function of past action history and payoff differences. Instead of relying on neural network architectures, the GP uses a kernel-based approach to interpolate between observed payoff outcomes, capturing uncertainty and smoothness in coordination behavior. The model outputs a posterior predictive probability of coordination, and the row player selects \"Coordination\" when the 95% confidence interval of the prediction exceeds 0.70.",
