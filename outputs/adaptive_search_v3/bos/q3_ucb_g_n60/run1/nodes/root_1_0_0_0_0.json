  "strategy": "Adopt a piecewise-linear threshold adaptation strategy where the coordination threshold evolves linearly over time based on the cumulative average of past noise values. Specifically, if the average noise over the last 5 rounds exceeds 0.4, the threshold increases by 0.01 per round; otherwise, it decreases by 0.005 per round. This creates a dynamic, learning-based adjustment that responds to actual noise patterns rather than a fixed or sinusoidal rhythm, potentially outpacing the column player\u2019s ability to predict or counteract the threshold changes.",
