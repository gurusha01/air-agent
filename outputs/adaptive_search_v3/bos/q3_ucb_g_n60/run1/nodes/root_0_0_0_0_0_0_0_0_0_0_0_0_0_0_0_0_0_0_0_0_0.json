  "strategy": "Introduce a reinforcement learning with imitation learning (IL) framework where the row player observes historical action pairs and learns to mimic high-payoff strategies from a curated set of expert behavior trajectories. Instead of modeling temporal dependencies via GNNs, we use a behavior cloning approach where the policy network is trained on a dataset of expert-played action pairs from known optimal outcomes in the Battle of Sexes game. The model learns to map observed state features (e.g., opponent's past actions, current payoff context) directly to action choices, using a feedforward neural network with attention over past interactions. This strategy emphasizes direct imitation of successful patterns rather than relational or structural modeling.",
