  "strategy": "Use a time-series forecasting model with a state-space representation (e.g., Kalman filter) to estimate the opponent's action transition probabilities. The model tracks the opponent's action history as a hidden state and updates its belief about future actions based on observed behavior. The row player then selects the action that maximizes the expected payoff under a belief updated via Bayesian updating, incorporating a smoothness penalty to avoid overfitting to short-term fluctuations. The feature engineering focuses on dynamic state transitions (e.g., P(opponent switches from A to B) over time) and incorporates a moving window of 5 rounds to capture evolving patterns. The stochastic policy adds noise only to the belief update, not to the action selection, to preserve stability.",
