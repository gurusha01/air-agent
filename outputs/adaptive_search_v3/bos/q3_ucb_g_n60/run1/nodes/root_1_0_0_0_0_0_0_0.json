  "strategy": "Replace the linear regression model with a non-parametric Bayesian approach using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to model the expected payoff of each action. Instead of relying on fixed feature vectors, the GPR model learns the underlying function mapping the column player's past action sequence (encoded as a time series embedding via a sliding window of 5 rounds) to the expected payoff. The model incorporates uncertainty estimates directly into the decision policy\u2014selecting \"Coordination\" if the posterior mean of the expected payoff exceeds a threshold derived from the uncertainty band (e.g., 95% confidence interval). This introduces adaptive uncertainty-aware decision-making, allowing the row player to explore when the model is uncertain about the column player's behavior.",
