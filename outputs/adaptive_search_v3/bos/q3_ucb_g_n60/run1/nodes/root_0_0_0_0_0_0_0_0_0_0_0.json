  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic threshold adaptation model based on moving average volatility of opponent actions. Instead of relying on fixed lags, compute a rolling 3-round moving average of the column player's cooperation decisions. When the volatility (standard deviation) of these actions exceeds a threshold, the row player temporarily reduces cooperation probability to 0.30 to signal unpredictability. When volatility is low, cooperation increases to 0.80 to exploit stable patterns. This strategy uses statistical volatility as a signal of opponent stability and dynamically adjusts cooperation in response to behavioral consistency.",
