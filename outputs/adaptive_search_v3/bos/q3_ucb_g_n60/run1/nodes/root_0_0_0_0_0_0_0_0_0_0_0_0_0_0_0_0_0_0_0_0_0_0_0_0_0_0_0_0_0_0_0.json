  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that models the game state as a dynamic graph where each time step is a node, and edges represent temporal or behavioral dependencies between actions. The GNN aggregates information from past moves (both row player and opponent) using message-passing, capturing complex relational patterns such as reciprocity, cycles, or sudden shifts. The final action is predicted via a learned readout function applied to the aggregated node features. This approach allows the model to reason about structural patterns in opponent behavior beyond simple sequences.",
