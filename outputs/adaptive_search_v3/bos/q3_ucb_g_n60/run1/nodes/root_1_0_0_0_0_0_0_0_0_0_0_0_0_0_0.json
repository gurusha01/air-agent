  "strategy": "Implement a Random Forest classifier to predict the column player's action based on historical payoff vectors and action sequences. Instead of modeling smooth latent functions, the model uses tree-based splitting on features such as the average payoff difference between rounds, the frequency of prior coordination, and the time since last conflict. Each leaf node outputs a probability of \"Coordination\" based on majority voting among training samples. The row player chooses \"Coordination\" when the predicted probability exceeds 0.62, adjusted dynamically based on recent volatility in payoff patterns.",
