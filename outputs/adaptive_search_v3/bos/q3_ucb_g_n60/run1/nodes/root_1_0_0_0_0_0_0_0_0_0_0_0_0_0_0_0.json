  "strategy": "Implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers to model the temporal dynamics of the column player's behavior. Instead of using static features, the model processes sequences of past action pairs and payoff differences as time-series inputs, capturing evolving patterns in coordination tendencies. The RNN learns latent state transitions and outputs a probability of \"Coordination\" at each time step. The row player selects \"Coordination\" when the predicted probability exceeds 0.68, with a dynamic threshold adjusted based on the variance of recent payoff changes.",
