  "strategy": "Adopt a time-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing \"Cooperate\" based on the lagged move of the column player. Specifically, if the column player cooperated in the previous round, the row player increases the probability of cooperating to 0.8; if they defected, the row player shifts to 0.4. This introduces dynamic adaptation, mimicking behavioral feedback loops observed in real-world interactions. The strategy is modeled after a simple recurrent rule-based system with memory of one prior action.",
