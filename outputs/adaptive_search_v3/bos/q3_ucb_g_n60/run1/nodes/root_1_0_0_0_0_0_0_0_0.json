  "strategy": "Use a Transformer-based sequence model with self-attention to encode the column player's action history as a dynamic context-aware signal. Instead of using a sliding window embedding, the model processes the full history of past actions as a sequence, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual shifts in behavior. The row player selects \"Coordination\" when the model's predicted payoff exceeds a dynamic threshold based on the attention-weighted confidence across time steps, allowing for real-time adaptation to behavioral patterns. This approach replaces the GPR with a deep sequential model that learns complex, non-linear temporal dynamics.",
