  "strategy": "Implement a transformer-based model with a self-attention mechanism focused on encoding the column player's action history using tokenized time steps. Each action is represented as a discrete token with positional embeddings to preserve temporal order. The attention layer computes a dynamic weight distribution over past actions, and the row player selects \"Coordination\" when the weighted average of past actions (with attention scores as weights) exceeds a threshold derived from the moving average of the opponent\u2019s payoff variance over the last 5 rounds. This approach shifts from internal state dynamics to explicit attention over action history, enabling finer-grained behavioral modeling.",
