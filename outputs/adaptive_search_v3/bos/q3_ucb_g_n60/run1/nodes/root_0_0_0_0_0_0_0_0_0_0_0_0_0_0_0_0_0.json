  "strategy": "Introduce a sparse autoencoder with a contrastive learning objective to compress the opponent's action sequence into a low-dimensional latent representation. The autoencoder learns a latent space where similar behavioral patterns (e.g., alternating preferences) are grouped together, and the row player uses this latent embedding to dynamically adjust the payoff matrix via a linear transformation. This approach emphasizes feature disentanglement and reduces noise in historical patterns, enabling more stable exploitation of opponent preferences. The latent representation is updated every 3 time steps using a contrastive loss that encourages similar actions to be close in embedding space.",
