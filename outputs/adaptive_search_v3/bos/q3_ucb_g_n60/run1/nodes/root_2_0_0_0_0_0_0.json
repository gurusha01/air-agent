  "strategy": "Implement a strategy based on time-of-day clustering and historical co-occurrence patterns. Analyze past joint activity logs (e.g., calendar entries, app usage timestamps) to identify recurring time windows when the row player and partner tend to be available. For example, if data shows that movie nights consistently occur between 8\u201310 PM on weekends, and sports activities peak between 5\u20137 PM on weekdays, the row player selects \"movie\" with 70% probability during evening hours and \"sports\" with 70% probability during weekday mornings. This approach uses temporal clustering (via Gaussian Mixture Models) to infer partner availability patterns, rather than sentiment. The model is trained on lagged historical data with a sliding window of 30 days.",
