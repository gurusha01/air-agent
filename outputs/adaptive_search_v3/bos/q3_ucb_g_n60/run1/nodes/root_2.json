Specifically, if the time is between 6 PM and 8 PM, the row player chooses \"movie\" with 70% probability; otherwise, they choose \"sports\" with 70% probability. This leverages the behavioral pattern that couples often have different preferences based on time of day, introducing a subtle but exploitable structure in the game.",
