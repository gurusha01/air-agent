  "strategy": "Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to model the sequence of column player actions. Each time step is encoded as a vector representing the opponent's action and the payoff received in that round. The LSTM captures temporal dependencies and builds a hidden state that reflects the evolving strategy of the column player. The row player selects \"Coordination\" when the hidden state\u2019s output exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold based on the cumulative variance of the column player\u2019s action pattern over the last 10 rounds. This approach leverages sequential memory without explicit tokenization, focusing instead on continuous state evolution.",
