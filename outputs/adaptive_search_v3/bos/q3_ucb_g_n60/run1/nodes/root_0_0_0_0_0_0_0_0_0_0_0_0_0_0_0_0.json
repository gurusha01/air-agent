  "strategy": "Introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that models the interaction history as a dynamic graph where each time step is a node, and edges represent temporal or strategic dependencies between actions (e.g., mutual action pairs or co-occurrence patterns). The GNN learns relational patterns across the opponent's behavior, such as preference cycles or behavioral clustering, and computes a contextual payoff matrix per time step. The row player selects actions using a learned graph-based action value function, with temperature decay to balance exploration and exploitation. This approach captures non-local dependencies and asymmetric influence patterns in the game history, which are missed by Transformers and LSTMs.",
