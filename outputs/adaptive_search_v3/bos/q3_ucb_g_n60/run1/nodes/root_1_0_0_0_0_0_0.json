  "strategy": "Implement a contextual bandit approach where the row player uses a linear model with online learning to predict the expected payoff of each action (\"Coordination\" or \"Independence\") based on a feature vector composed of the column player's past action patterns (e.g., frequency of Coordination/Independence), the temporal autocorrelation of their actions over the last 4 rounds, and a normalized measure of recent noise volatility. The model is updated after each round using stochastic gradient descent with a fixed learning rate, and the action selection is determined by the policy that maximizes the immediate predicted reward. This strategy leverages regression-based inference rather than Q-learning and introduces temporal dependencies through autocorrelation features.",
