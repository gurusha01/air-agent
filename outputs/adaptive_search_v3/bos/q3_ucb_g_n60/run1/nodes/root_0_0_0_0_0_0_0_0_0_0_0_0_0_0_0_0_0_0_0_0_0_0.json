  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic threshold-based policy that adjusts the row player's action selection based on real-time payoff estimation. Instead of relying on imitation of expert trajectories, the model computes a payoff threshold from the current opponent's history and selects actions that exceed a dynamically updated threshold derived from the expected value of coordination vs. individual preference. The threshold evolves using a simple moving average of recent payoffs, with a decay factor of 0.95 to maintain responsiveness. This strategy avoids neural modeling entirely and uses only scalar statistics and temporal smoothing to guide decisions.",
