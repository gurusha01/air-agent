  "strategy": "Introduce a Random Forest ensemble model to predict coordination outcomes by treating past action histories and payoff differences as input features. Each tree in the ensemble learns non-linear interactions between actions and payoff disparities, and the final prediction is aggregated via majority voting. Instead of relying on smooth interpolation, the model captures discrete behavioral patterns in coordination, with leaf nodes assigning coordination probabilities based on feature splits. The row player selects \"Coordination\" when the out-of-bag (OOB) prediction probability exceeds 0.75, accounting for model uncertainty through bootstrap resampling.",
