  "strategy": "Use a Gaussian Process Regression model to predict the column player's action based on historical payoff patterns. Instead of relying on attention or sequence modeling, the model learns a probabilistic mapping from past rounds' payoffs and action sequences to the likelihood of the column player choosing \"Coordination\" or \"Conflict.\" The row player selects \"Coordination\" if the predicted probability of the column player choosing \"Coordination\" exceeds 0.65, derived from a kernel-based interpolation of past behavior. This approach treats the game as a regression problem where the column player\u2019s preferences are modeled as a smooth, latent function.",
