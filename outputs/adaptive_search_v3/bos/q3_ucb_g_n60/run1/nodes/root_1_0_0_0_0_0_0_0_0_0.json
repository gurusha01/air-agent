  "strategy": "Implement a recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to model the column player's action sequence, where each LSTM cell captures temporal dependencies in the opponent's behavior. Instead of relying on attention weights, the LSTM outputs a hidden state that is continuously updated and used to compute a real-time expected payoff. The row player chooses \"Coordination\" when the LSTM\u2019s output exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold derived from the variance of past hidden states, signaling a shift in opponent behavior. This approach leverages sequential memory dynamics without explicit attention mechanisms, focusing on internal state stability and volatility as a decision signal.",
