  "strategy": "Apply a phase-shifted opponent response prediction model using a lagged correlation matrix. Instead of tracking raw payoff trends, compute the cross-correlation between the row player's cooperation decisions and the column player's observed actions from up to 5 past rounds. The model identifies a phase lag where cooperation is most likely to be met with a specific response (e.g., defection or cooperation). Once the optimal lag is detected, the row player increases cooperation probability by 0.15 when the lagged opponent behavior indicates a high probability of mutual cooperation. This strategy leverages time-delayed signal processing and assumes the opponent has a finite response time, creating a predictive edge based on temporal filtering.",
