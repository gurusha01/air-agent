If the time is between 18:00 and 22:00 (evenings), the row player chooses \"movie\" with 70% probability; otherwise, they choose \"sports\" with 70% probability. This leverages the behavioral pattern that couples often prefer indoor activities during evenings, while outdoor activities are more common in the day. The time signal is more consistent and less subject to weather variability than temperature.",
