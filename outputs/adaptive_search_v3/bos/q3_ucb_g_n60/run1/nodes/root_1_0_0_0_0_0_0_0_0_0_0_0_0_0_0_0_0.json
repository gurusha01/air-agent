  "strategy": "Replace the RNN with a Transformer-based model that processes past action sequences using self-attention mechanisms. Instead of focusing on sequential time steps, the model captures long-range dependencies in coordination patterns by attending to all past action pairs and payoff differences simultaneously. The output is a predicted coordination probability, and the row player chooses \"Coordination\" when this probability exceeds 0.72. This approach improves sensitivity to subtle, non-linear coordination signals that LSTM layers may miss due to their sequential memory limitations.",
