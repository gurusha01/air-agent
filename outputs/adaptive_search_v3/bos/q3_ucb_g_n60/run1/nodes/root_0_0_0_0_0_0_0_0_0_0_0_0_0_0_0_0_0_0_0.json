  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based attention mechanism to dynamically weigh past opponent actions based on their temporal relevance, using a self-attention layer that learns attention weights over time. Instead of relying on LSTM hidden states, this model computes a time-aware representation of the opponent\u2019s behavior by assigning higher attention to actions that are more predictive of future moves. The row player then uses these attention-weighted features to adaptively modify the payoff matrix in real time, focusing on high-impact historical patterns. This strategy leverages parallel computation and long-range dependencies without relying on sequential memory cells.",
