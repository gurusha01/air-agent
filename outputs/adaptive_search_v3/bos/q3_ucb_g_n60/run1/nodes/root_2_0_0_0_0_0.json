On days when positive sentiment toward \"movie nights\" spikes (e.g., keywords like \"watching movies,\" \"home cinema,\" \"late night film\"), the row player selects \"movie\" with 80% probability. Conversely, if sentiment around outdoor activities (e.g., \"gym,\" \"hiking,\" \"sports,\" \"outdoor game\") increases, they choose \"sports\" with 80% probability. This leverages public emotional trends as a proxy for partner preferences, using a streaming NLP pipeline to detect shifts in real time.",
