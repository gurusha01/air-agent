  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based RNN with a Transformer encoder that processes the opponent's action history as a sequence of tokens, where each token encodes the action (0 or 1) and the round modulo 4. Instead of using a sliding window, the model uses a full sequence of the last 8 rounds, with self-attention to capture long-range dependencies. The output is a value estimate for each action, and the row player selects the action with the highest predicted payoff, using a deterministic policy with a small epsilon-greedy exploration (epsilon = 0.05) to maintain adaptability. This approach leverages attention-based modeling to better detect patterns in opponent behavior that may not be apparent in short-term windows.",
