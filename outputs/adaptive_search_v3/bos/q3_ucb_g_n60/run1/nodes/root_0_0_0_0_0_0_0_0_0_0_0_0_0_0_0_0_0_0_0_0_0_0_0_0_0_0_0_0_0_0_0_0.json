  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based sequential model that treats the game as a time-series of action pairs, where each token is a (row player action, opponent action) pair. The model uses self-attention to identify long-range dependencies and strategic patterns (e.g., coordination attempts, defection cycles), and outputs a probability distribution over actions for the current turn using a learned decoder. The model is trained on historical game logs to maximize expected payoff under the assumption of opponent adaptability. This approach captures contextual shifts and anticipates opponent strategy changes based on prior interaction patterns.",
