  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based temporal model with a Transformer architecture that processes the opponent's action sequence using self-attention mechanisms. Instead of relying on sequential dependencies through recurrence, the Transformer captures global patterns across the entire history of actions, enabling it to detect complex, non-linear behavioral shifts. The row player uses the Transformer's output to compute expected payoffs and selects actions via softmax over a learned action-value distribution, with exploration controlled by a decaying temperature parameter (instead of epsilon-greedy). This approach leverages parallel computation and attention to identify high-value action patterns across long horizons, improving adaptability to non-stationary opponents.",
