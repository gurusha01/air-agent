  "strategy": "Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a LSTM layer to model the opponent's behavioral sequence. Instead of using lagged actions as static features, the LSTM processes the opponent's historical actions over time as a temporal sequence, capturing long-range dependencies and patterns in behavior. The row player computes the expected payoff for each action using the LSTM's output and selects the action with the highest value, applying epsilon-greedy exploration with a decaying epsilon schedule. The model is trained on a sliding window of past rounds, with batch updates after every 10 rounds to ensure stability and adaptability.",
