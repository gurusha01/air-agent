  "strategy": "Apply a stochastic gradient descent-style learning rule where the row player updates its cooperation probability based on the immediate payoff difference from the previous round. Specifically, if the row player received a higher payoff when cooperating, it increases cooperation probability by 0.05; otherwise, it decreases by 0.05, capped between 0.1 and 0.9. This strategy uses real-time reward feedback to guide adaptation, treating the game as a reinforcement learning problem with continuous parameter updates.",
