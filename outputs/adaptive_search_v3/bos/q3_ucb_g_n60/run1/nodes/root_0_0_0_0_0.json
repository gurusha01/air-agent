  "strategy": "The row player adopts a strategy based on the fractional part of the square root of the round number. Specifically, the cooperation probability is set to 0.5 + 0.5 * (sqrt(round_number) mod 1), which results in a non-repeating, chaotic pattern derived from irrational dynamics. This strategy avoids periodicity and leverages the fact that square roots have dense, non-periodic fractional parts, making it difficult for the column player to detect or exploit patterns.",
