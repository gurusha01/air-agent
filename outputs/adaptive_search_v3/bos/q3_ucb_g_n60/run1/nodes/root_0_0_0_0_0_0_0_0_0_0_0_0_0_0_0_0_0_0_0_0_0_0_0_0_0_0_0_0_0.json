  "strategy": "Apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to model the opponent's action sequence as a time-series of hidden states. Instead of using a fixed window or transition probabilities, the LSTM learns a dynamic representation of the opponent\u2019s behavioral patterns directly from observed action sequences. The row player computes the expected payoff using a learned posterior distribution over the opponent\u2019s next action and selects the action that maximizes the expected utility. Feature engineering includes attention-based weighting of recent actions and a temporal dependency score derived from the LSTM\u2019s internal state. The model is trained on historical data with a teacher-forcing scheme to improve stability during training. Action selection remains deterministic based on the predicted action distribution, with no added noise to preserve consistency.",
