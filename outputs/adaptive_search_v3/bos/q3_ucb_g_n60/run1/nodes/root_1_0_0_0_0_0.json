  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based policy where the row player uses a Q-learning agent to learn the value of choosing \"Coordination\" or \"Independence\" based on the observed history of column player actions and noise levels. The state includes the last 3 rounds' actions, the average noise over the past 5 rounds, and a moving window of 3 consecutive noise values. The agent updates its Q-values after each round using \u03b5-greedy exploration with \u03b5 decaying exponentially. This strategy learns adaptive payoff maximization through direct experience, avoiding pre-defined threshold rules.",
