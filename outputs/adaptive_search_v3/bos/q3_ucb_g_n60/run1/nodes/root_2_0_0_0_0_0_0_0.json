  "strategy": "Apply a dynamic reinforcement learning policy where the row player adjusts strategy based on real-time partner feedback (e.g., app notifications, voice logs) using a Q-learning model with epsilon-greedy exploration. The model observes whether the partner expresses preference (e.g., \"I prefer movies\") immediately after each action and updates action-value estimates over time. The state includes current time, day of week, and a recent sentiment score derived from text snippets (e.g., \"I\u2019m free\" or \"Let\u2019s go to the gym\"). This approach shifts from static clustering to adaptive learning via interaction.",
