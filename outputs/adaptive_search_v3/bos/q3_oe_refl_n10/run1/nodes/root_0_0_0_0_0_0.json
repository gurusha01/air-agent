  "reflection": "The reinforcement learning approach in **root_0_0_0** (score: 1.4026) has been the most successful, outperforming all other strategies by over 30% relative gain. This success stems from the use of **Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration**, where the state is explicitly defined by the column player\u2019s last 4 actions and the round number\u2014enabling the model to learn temporal patterns and adapt dynamically. In contrast, strategies relying on simple thresholds or static mixed strategies (e.g., root_0_0: 1.3083, root_0: 1.0495) fail to capture behavioral dynamics, resulting in lower scores due to lack of adaptation. Notably, **dynamic thresholding over 5 rounds (root_0_0_0_0: 0.9235)** and **cyclic time-varying strategies (root_1: 0.7387)** have consistently underperformed, likely because they lack sufficient sensitivity to opponent behavior and fail to exploit non-stationary patterns. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0_0_0** (score: 1.3040), which implements a **periodic mirroring strategy** based on every 3rd round observation. To improve upon this, we should refine the mirroring logic by incorporating **a sliding window of the last 3 actions** and **adding a small noise component to break predictability**, while maintaining the same state definition (last 4 actions + round) to preserve consistency with the high-performing Q-learning baseline. This targeted refinement leverages the structure of the successful RL model while testing a simpler, interpretable alterna..."
