  "strategy": "Adopt a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to model opponent behavior as a sequence of actions. Instead of using self-attention, the LSTM processes the historical sequence of opponent actions through hidden state propagation, capturing temporal dependencies via gated memory cells. The row player predicts the opponent's next action based on the LSTM's final hidden state and selects the action that maximizes the expected payoff, with a dynamic threshold for switching between actions based on predicted confidence. This approach emphasizes sequential memory and internal state evolution over direct pattern matching.",
