  "strategy": "Apply a Bayesian Nonparametric approach using a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) to model the opponent's action distribution over time. Instead of using fixed basis functions, this method adaptively clusters historical action sequences into latent behavioral types (e.g., \"cooperative,\" \"defect-first,\" \"random\"), updating the posterior probability of each type as new data arrives. The row player selects actions based on the expected payoff under the most likely behavioral type, with posterior updates using a conjugate Bayesian framework. This strategy avoids explicit function approximation and relies on probabilistic inference to identify opponent patterns, enabling robustness to structural shifts in behavior.",
