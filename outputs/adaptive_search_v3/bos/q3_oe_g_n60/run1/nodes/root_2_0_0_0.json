  "strategy": "Implement a genetic algorithm-driven evolutionary strategy where the row player's action probabilities evolve over time through natural selection. Each strategy is represented as a vector of action probabilities, and fitness is evaluated based on historical payoff outcomes. Every round, offspring are generated via crossover and mutation, and the fittest strategies survive. The population is updated every 100 rounds, with selection pressure tuned to favor coordination when opponent patterns are detected via simple sliding window frequency analysis. This approach avoids neural networks entirely and relies on population-level adaptation instead of real-time prediction.",
