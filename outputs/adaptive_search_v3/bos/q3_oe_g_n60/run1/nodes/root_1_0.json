  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player updates its choice probabilities using Q-learning, with state features derived from the opponent's last 5 rounds' choices and the round number modulo 3. The action selection is guided by maximizing expected cumulative reward, with a discount factor of 0.9. The strategy adapts dynamically based on observed transitions between opponent actions, treating each state-action pair as a learning unit. This approach introduces temporal credit assignment and handles long-term dependencies beyond simple past frequencies.",
