  "strategy": "Introduce a meta-imitation strategy where the row player observes and mimics the opponent's past actions with a stochastic delay, treating the opponent as a dynamic policy that evolves over time. Instead of directly estimating action-values, the row player maintains a weighted average of the opponent\u2019s recent action history, with a decay factor applied to older actions. The row player then selects the action that aligns with the most recent opponent behavior, but with a randomized offset to prevent predictability. This approach leverages behavioral pattern detection without explicit modeling of reward structures.",
