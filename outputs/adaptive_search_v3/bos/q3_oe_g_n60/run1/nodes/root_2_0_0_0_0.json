  "strategy": "Implement a time-delayed feedback strategy where the row player adjusts action probabilities based on the lagged opponent action history (e.g., 3-round delay) using a simple autoregressive model (AR(1)) to predict opponent behavior. The row player then coordinates with a high probability when the opponent's past actions show a consistent pattern of selecting the same option, and randomizes otherwise. This leverages temporal dependencies without relying on neural networks or population dynamics.",
