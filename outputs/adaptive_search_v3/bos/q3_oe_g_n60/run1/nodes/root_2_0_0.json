The RNN updates its internal state to predict the opponent's next move and adjusts the row player's action probabilities accordingly\u2014favoring coordination when the opponent has consistently chosen the same action, and randomizing when patterns break. Contextual features like time of day are embedded as inputs to modulate the RNN's output, allowing for temporal adaptation. This approach introduces a feedback loop that learns opponent behavior over time with temporal dynamics.",
