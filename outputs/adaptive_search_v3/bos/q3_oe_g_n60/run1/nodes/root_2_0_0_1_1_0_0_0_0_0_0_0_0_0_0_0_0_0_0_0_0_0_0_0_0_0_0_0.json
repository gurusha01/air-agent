  "strategy": "Apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units to model the opponent's action sequence as a time-dependent process. Instead of latent states, the LSTM learns continuous embeddings of past actions and temporal patterns directly from raw observation sequences. The row player uses the LSTM's hidden state to compute a real-time belief about the opponent's current intention and selects actions that maximize the expected payoff under a learned policy, updated incrementally via online gradient descent with a fixed learning rate. This approach captures complex, non-linear temporal dependencies without explicit state discretization.",
