  "strategy": "Use a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with dilated convolutions to model the sequential dynamics of opponent actions. Instead of treating rounds as nodes in a graph, the TCN captures long-range temporal dependencies in action sequences through stacked dilated convolutions. Features include lagged action history (e.g., last 5 rounds), action co-occurrence patterns, and temporal gaps between actions. The model predicts opponent action probabilities directly from the time-series history, and the row player chooses the action with the highest expected payoff based on this temporal prediction. This approach emphasizes sequential memory over relational graph structure.",
