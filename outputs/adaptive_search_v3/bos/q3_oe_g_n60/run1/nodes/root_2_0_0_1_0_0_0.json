  "strategy": "Introduce a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian model that treats the opponent's move history as a stochastic process with latent dynamics. Instead of learning fixed patterns, the model infers a probabilistic transition function between actions (e.g., from \"cooperate\" to \"defect\") and updates beliefs continuously based on observed outcomes. The model dynamically adjusts its confidence in predictions using posterior variance, allowing for adaptive bluffing or coordination when uncertainty is high. Action selection is made by sampling from a posterior distribution weighted by the expected utility of each move given current belief states. This approach avoids overfitting through probabilistic regularization and leverages uncertainty as a signal for exploration.",
