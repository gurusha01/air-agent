  "strategy": "Apply a reinforcement learning with eligibility traces (ELT) to model the opponent's action history, where the row player updates its policy based on delayed rewards using a temporal difference learning framework. Instead of clustering behavioral types, this method tracks action-value estimates with a decaying eligibility trace that assigns credit to past actions. The row player selects actions that maximize the estimated future payoff, with trace decay controlled by a hyperparameter (\u03b3 = 0.9). This approach introduces dynamic reward anticipation and adapts to opponent behavior through direct interaction feedback, avoiding prior clustering assumptions.",
