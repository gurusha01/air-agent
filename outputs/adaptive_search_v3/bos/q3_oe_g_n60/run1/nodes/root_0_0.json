  "strategy": "Adopt a fully adaptive mixed strategy using a Kalman filter to estimate the column player's hidden preference (e.g., whether they favor Cooperation or Defection) over time. The row player updates their action probabilities based on a dynamic belief state, treating the column player's choices as noisy observations of an unobserved latent variable. The row player then chooses Cooperate with probability proportional to the estimated belief that the column player prefers Cooperation, and Defect otherwise. This approach incorporates state estimation and uncertainty modeling, unlike reinforcement learning or simple heuristics.",
