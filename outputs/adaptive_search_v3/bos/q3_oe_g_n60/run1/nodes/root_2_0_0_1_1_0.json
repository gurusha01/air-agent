  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic threshold-based strategy where the row player monitors the opponent's action sequence and activates a random deviation (cooperate or defect) only when the opponent's cooperation rate drops below a dynamically adjusted threshold. The threshold is updated every 5 rounds using a sliding window average of past cooperation rates, with a decay factor of 0.95 to reduce sensitivity to short-term fluctuations. This strategy leverages a piecewise constant threshold function that adapts to opponent behavior, introducing unpredictability when the opponent shows signs of inconsistency. The model uses a simple exponential moving average to compute the threshold and resets it if the opponent's behavior stabilizes for 3 consecutive rounds.",
