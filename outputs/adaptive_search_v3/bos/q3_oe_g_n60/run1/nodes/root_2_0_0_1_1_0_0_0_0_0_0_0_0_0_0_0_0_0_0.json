  "strategy": "Adopt a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to model the opponent's action sequence, focusing on hidden state dynamics rather than raw lagged features. Instead of using fixed lags, the LSTM learns internal representations of the opponent\u2019s behavioral patterns over time. Features include the hidden state at each time step, attention-weighted past actions, and temporal variance in action timing. The row player selects the action that maximizes expected payoff based on the LSTM's predicted probability distribution of the opponent\u2019s next move. This strategy emphasizes dynamic state evolution over static lag features.",
