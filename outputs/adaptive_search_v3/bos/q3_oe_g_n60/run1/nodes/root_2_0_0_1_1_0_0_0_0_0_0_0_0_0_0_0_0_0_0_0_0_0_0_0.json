  "strategy": "Apply a time-series-based dynamic adjustment strategy using a Kalman filter to track the opponent's action pattern over time. The row player models the opponent's choice probability as a latent state evolving over time and updates the belief about the opponent's behavior using a state-space model. The Kalman filter estimates the current probability of the opponent choosing each action based on past observed actions, and the row player selects the action that maximizes expected payoff under the filtered estimate. This approach explicitly accounts for temporal dynamics and noise in opponent behavior, moving beyond static Bayesian modeling.",
