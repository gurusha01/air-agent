  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic threshold-based strategy where the row player observes the opponent's action sequence over a 5-round window and computes a running sum of action consistency. If the opponent selects the same option in at least 4 out of 5 consecutive rounds, the row player responds with the opposite option (coordination via misalignment) to disrupt patterns. Otherwise, the row player randomizes between actions with equal probability. This strategy leverages pattern detection via a simple threshold rule and introduces a deliberate counter-strategy to exploit predictable behavior.",
