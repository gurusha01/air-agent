  "strategy": "Apply a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the opponent's type (e.g., cooperative vs. selfish), and updates this distribution based on observed actions using Bayes' rule. The row player then selects actions that maximize expected payoff under the current belief, updating the belief after each interaction using observed outcomes. This approach explicitly models opponent heterogeneity and uses probabilistic inference to adapt dynamically without relying on Q-learning or reinforcement learning.",
