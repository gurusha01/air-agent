  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) approximation using conjugate priors to model the opponent's mixed strategy. Instead of learning through reinforcement, the row player maintains a posterior over the opponent's strategy distribution (e.g., beta-binomial for probability of choosing each action) and updates it via observed outcomes. The row player then selects the action that maximizes expected payoff under the current posterior, adjusting the prior based on the likelihood of observed actions. This approach leverages probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty quantification to adaptively choose actions without relying on temporal updates or value function approximation.",
