  "strategy": "Adopt a reinforcement learning-based policy where the row player adjusts cooperation probability in real-time based on the opponent's historical actions, using a Q-learning framework with a discount factor of 0.9. The strategy learns from past interactions to anticipate the opponent's preferred move and dynamically updates the cooperation probability to maximize long-term average payoff. This approach uses temporal difference learning with episodic feedback to adapt to opponent behavior patterns.",
