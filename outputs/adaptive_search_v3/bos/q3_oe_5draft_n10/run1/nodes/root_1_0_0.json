  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player estimates the column player's preference (bias toward Action A or B) based on a conjugate prior distribution (Beta distribution), updated after each observed action. The probability of choosing Action A is then set to the posterior mean, incorporating a small exploration term (\u03b5 = 0.05) to maintain unpredictability. This approach uses probabilistic inference rather than reinforcement learning or time-series forecasting.",
