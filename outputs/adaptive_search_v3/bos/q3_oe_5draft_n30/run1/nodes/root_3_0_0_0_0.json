  "strategy": "Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) with 1D convolutions to extract local temporal patterns from the sequence of column player actions. Instead of relying on sequential RNNs, the CNN processes the last 10 rounds as a fixed-length temporal window, using convolutional filters to detect recurring motifs (e.g., cooperation-defection-cooperation) and spatial correlations across time. The output is a cooperation probability derived from a max-pooling layer followed by a fully connected layer. This approach emphasizes spatial patterns over sequential dependencies, leveraging the CNN\u2019s strength in pattern recognition from structured time-series data.",
