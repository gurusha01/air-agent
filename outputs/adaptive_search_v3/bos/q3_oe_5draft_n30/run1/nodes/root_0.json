  "strategy": "Adopt a time-varying mixed strategy where the row player adjusts their choice (Cooperate or Defect) based on a random walk process with a drift toward the opponent's historical preference. Specifically, the row player observes the opponent's past actions over a 3-round window and updates their internal state with a small probability of switching direction (e.g., 10% chance per round). The strategy then selects \"Cooperate\" with probability proportional to the number of times the opponent chose \"Cooperate\" in the past 3 rounds, otherwise \"Defect\" with the remainder. This introduces adaptive learning and avoids predictable patterns.",
