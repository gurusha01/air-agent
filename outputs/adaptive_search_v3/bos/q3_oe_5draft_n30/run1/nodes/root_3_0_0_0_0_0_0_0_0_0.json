  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic payoff correlation tracking strategy that computes the rolling correlation coefficient between the row player's action and the column player's payoff over the last 15 rounds. If the correlation is positive and above 0.3, the row player increases the probability of choosing the cooperative action to 0.7. This strategy assumes that consistent alignment in actions leads to higher payoffs for the row player, and leverages statistical dependence rather than simple payoff differences.",
