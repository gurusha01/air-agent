  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based policy that uses a Q-learning agent to estimate the value of each action (cooperative or competitive) based on the column player's past actions and the resulting payoffs. The agent updates its Q-values after each round using a learning rate of 0.1 and explores actions with an epsilon-greedy strategy (epsilon = 0.1). The row player selects the action with the highest estimated value, and the policy is updated after each interaction. This strategy learns from long-term payoff patterns rather than relying on correlation.",
