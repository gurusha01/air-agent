  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic threshold-based strategy that monitors the average payoff of the column player over the last 5 rounds. If the average payoff exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold (initially set at 0.85 and updated every 10 rounds based on historical performance), the row player switches to a cooperative action with probability 0.7. Otherwise, it defaults to defection. The threshold adapts using a simple exponential moving average with weight 0.3, enabling responsive behavior to detect sustained cooperation. This strategy avoids neural modeling entirely and relies on statistical monitoring and rule-based adaptation.",
