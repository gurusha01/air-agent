  "strategy": "Implement a payoff asymmetry detection strategy that tracks the difference in cumulative payoffs between the row and column player over the last 10 rounds. If the row player's payoff is consistently below the column player's by more than 0.15, the row player switches to a cooperative action with probability 0.6. Otherwise, it defaults to defection. This strategy leverages temporal payoff divergence as a signal for strategic imbalance, using simple arithmetic differences rather than thresholds or moving averages.",
