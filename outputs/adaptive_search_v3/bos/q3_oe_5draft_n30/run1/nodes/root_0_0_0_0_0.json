If the correlation is above 0.7 (indicating strong behavioral alignment), the row player cooperates to exploit predictability; otherwise, it defects to induce uncertainty. This approach uses statistical dependence rather than sequential patterns or drift indicators, focusing on co-evolution dynamics in the game.",
