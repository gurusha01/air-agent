  "strategy": "Implement a sinusoidal phase-shift strategy where the row player's choice is determined by the phase of a sine wave function parameterized by the round number modulo 10. The wave is shifted based on the opponent's choice in round t-1: if the opponent chose 'Movie', the phase is shifted by +0.1; if 'Sports', by -0.1. The row player selects 'Movie' when the sine value is above 0.5, otherwise 'Sports'. This introduces periodic but non-repeating behavior that exploits opponent predictability through dynamic phase modulation, leveraging a cyclic model distinct from time-series or memory-based approaches.",
