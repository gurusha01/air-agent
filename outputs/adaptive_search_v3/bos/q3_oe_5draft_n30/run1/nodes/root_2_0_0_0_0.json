  "strategy": "The row player adopts a random walk with drift strategy: in each round, the choice is determined by a state variable that evolves as a biased random walk where the probability of choosing 'Movie' increases by a small fixed amount each round (drift), while the 'Sports' choice probability decreases accordingly. This creates a gradual shift in preference over time without cyclicity, making the behavior appear adaptive and non-repeating. The drift parameter is set to 0.01 per round, ensuring slow but consistent progression toward one choice.",
