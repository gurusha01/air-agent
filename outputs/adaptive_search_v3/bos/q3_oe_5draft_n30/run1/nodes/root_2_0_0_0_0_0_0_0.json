  "strategy": "Implement a piecewise-linear drift strategy where the probability of choosing 'Movie' increases in a non-smooth, segmented fashion over time, following a sawtooth pattern that resets every 100 time steps. The segments are defined by linear ramps from 0.3 to 0.7 over 50 steps, then drops to 0.3 over the next 50 steps, creating a periodic, predictable but irregular rhythm. This introduces complexity in the pattern to avoid simple sinusoidal prediction while maintaining a clear temporal structure. The strategy leverages the column player\u2019s tendency to overfit short-term trends by introducing abrupt transitions that break long-term forecasting.",
