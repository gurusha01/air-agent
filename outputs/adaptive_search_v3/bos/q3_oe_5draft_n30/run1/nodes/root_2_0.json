  "strategy": "Implement a time-series adaptive strategy where the row player uses a simple moving average of the opponent's last 5 choices to dynamically adjust the probability of selecting 'Movie' or 'Sports'. If the opponent has chosen 'Movie' more than twice in the last five rounds, the row player increases the probability of choosing 'Sports' to exploit potential pattern fatigue; otherwise, it defaults to a baseline of 0.6. This strategy leverages sequential behavior with minimal computational overhead and introduces a temporal memory mechanism distinct from feedback loops or mixed strategies.",
