  "strategy": "Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a GRU layer to model the sequence of column player actions over time. Instead of using only the last three actions, the RNN processes the full history of actions (up to 10 rounds) and outputs a real-valued cooperation probability. The model is trained to maximize the expected payoff from mutual cooperation, with a loss function incorporating both immediate rewards and a discount factor on future rewards. The RNN learns temporal dependencies in opponent behavior, such as patterns of alternating cooperation or defection, and adjusts its output dynamically. This approach captures long-term memory and context that traditional finite-state models miss.",
