  "reflection": "1. The reinforcement learning algorithm using the Q-learning method has shown the highest success rate so far, achieving a score of 0.9102. This method effectively learns optimal strategies by iteratively updating the row player's strategy based on feedback from the game environment. Additionally, implementing a deep neural network architecture focused on convolutional layers has also yielded promising results, demonstrating its ability to capture spatial relationships in the game board state.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include those that rely solely on static strategies without any form of adaptation or learning. For example, switching to a deep neural network architecture without incorporating reinforcement learning techniques did not yield significant improvements. Similarly, using evolutionary algorithms without fine-tuning parameters such as mutation rates and crossover probabilities may lead to suboptimal outcomes.\n\n3. The next experiment should focus on refining the Q-learning algorithm further by experimenting with different exploration strategies, such as epsilon-greedy or Boltzmann exploration. Additionally, incorporating eligibility traces into the Q-learning framework could potentially enhance convergence speed and stability. Another promising direction would be to combine Q-learning with elements of deep reinforcement learning, leveraging convolutional neural networks to represent the state space more efficiently.
