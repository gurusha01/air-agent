When the weather is sunny or clear (as determined by a weather API), the probability increases to 0.65, reflecting higher likelihood of outdoor coordination. When it is rainy, cloudy, or stormy, the probability drops to 0.25, indicating a preference for indoor alignment. This leverages environmental conditions as a dynamic signal of activity preferences.",
