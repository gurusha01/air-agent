  "strategy": "Implement a phase-shifted mirror strategy where the row player anticipates the column player's move based on a sinusoidal phase model, using historical move sequences to estimate a periodic component in the column player's behavior. The row player then offsets their action by a phase lag derived from a Fourier transform of the past 10 turns, effectively creating a delayed but predictable mirror response that breaks synchronization without relying on time delays or direct observation. This strategy leverages cyclical patterns in behavioral rhythms rather than temporal lag or belief updating.",
