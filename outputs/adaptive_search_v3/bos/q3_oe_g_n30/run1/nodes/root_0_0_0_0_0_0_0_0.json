  "strategy": "Implement a sentiment-based mixed strategy using real-time social media sentiment analysis from local forums and hashtags related to outdoor activities. When positive sentiment spikes (e.g., \"great weather\", \"perfect day for hiking\") are detected, the row player increases their probability of choosing the same activity to 0.70. When negative sentiment dominates (e.g., \"rainy\", \"no outdoor plans\"), the probability drops to 0.30. This leverages emotional cues from public discourse rather than weather or time. The model uses natural language processing to extract sentiment intensity and maps it to coordination probability.",
