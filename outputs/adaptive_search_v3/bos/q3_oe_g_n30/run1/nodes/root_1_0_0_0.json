  "strategy": "Introduce a time-of-day dependent mixed strategy where the row player's cooperation probability is modulated by the hour of day, using a sine-wave pattern that peaks at 8:00 AM and troughs at 10:00 PM. This leverages circadian rhythm cues that may influence the column player's behavior through perceived daily patterns, introducing a biologically grounded temporal structure. The strategy assumes the column player is more responsive to predictable, rhythmic behavior during morning hours, creating a strategic asymmetry in timing.",
