  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian reinforcement learning framework where the row player updates beliefs about the column player's preferences using a Dirichlet process prior. The model tracks the probability distribution over possible types of the column player (e.g., coordination-prone or coordination-averse) and updates it based on observed actions. The row player then selects actions that maximize expected utility under the current posterior belief, with a stochastic exploration component to avoid overfitting to recent patterns. Features include the sequence of column player choices and the row player\u2019s own choices, but instead of using raw sequences, we encode behavioral consistency via entropy-based measures of player stability.",
