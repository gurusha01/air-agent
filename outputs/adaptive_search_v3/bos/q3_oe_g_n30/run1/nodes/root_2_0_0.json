  "strategy": "Implement a temperature-based stochastic strategy where the row player's cooperation probability is modulated by a dynamically updated temperature parameter. The temperature starts at 1.0 and is increased by 0.1 if the column player defects in the last round, decreased by 0.1 if the column player cooperates, with a minimum of 0.3 and maximum of 2.0. The cooperation probability is then calculated as 1 / (1 + e^(temperature)), creating a soft threshold that adapts to behavioral volatility. This introduces a non-linear, thermodynamic-inspired learning mechanism that responds to immediate deviations.",
