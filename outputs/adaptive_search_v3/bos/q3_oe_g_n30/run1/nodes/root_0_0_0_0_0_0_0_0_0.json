  "strategy": "Implement a time-series forecasting model using LSTM networks to predict the likelihood of coordination based on historical player behavior patterns. The model is trained on past rounds of the game, using lagged choices (e.g., whether the row player chose hiking or dining in the previous 3 rounds) as input features. The LSTM outputs a conditional probability that the row player will coordinate (choose the same activity) in the next round, based on sequence dynamics. The probability is adjusted dynamically based on the model's confidence score, with a higher probability when the sequence shows consistent patterns of coordination.",
