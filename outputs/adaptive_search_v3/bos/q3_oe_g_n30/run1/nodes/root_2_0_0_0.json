  "strategy": "Implement a phase-shifted oscillatory strategy where the row player alternates between cooperation and defection in a sine-wave pattern with a frequency modulated by the column player's past behavior. If the column player cooperated in the last three rounds, the oscillation frequency increases by 0.1; if they defected, it decreases by 0.1, with a base frequency of 0.5. The cooperation decision is determined by whether the current phase of the sine wave (computed as sin(t) where t is round number scaled by frequency) exceeds 0.3. This introduces a rhythmic, time-dependent adaptation that avoids static thresholds and exploits cyclic patterns in opponent behavior.",
