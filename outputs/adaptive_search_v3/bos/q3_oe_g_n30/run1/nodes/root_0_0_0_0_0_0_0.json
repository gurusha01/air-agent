  "strategy": "Implement a weather-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts their probability of choosing the \"same activity\" based on real-time weather conditions. During sunny and warm conditions (temperature > 20\u00b0C and cloud cover < 30%), the probability increases to 0.75, as outdoor activities are more likely to align. In rainy or cold conditions (temperature < 10\u00b0C or precipitation > 50%), the probability drops to 0.25, reflecting reduced coordination potential due to environmental discomfort. This leverages meteorological signals rather than time of day.",
