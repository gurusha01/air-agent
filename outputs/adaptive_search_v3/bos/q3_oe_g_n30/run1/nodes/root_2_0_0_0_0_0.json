  "strategy": "Implement a phase-shifted sine-wave adaptation strategy where the row player's cooperation decision is modeled as a delayed, nonlinear function of the column player's past actions. Specifically, the cooperation decision is computed as: cooperation = 1 if sin(\u03c0 * (sum of past column player actions over last 5 rounds) / 5) > 0.5, otherwise defect. The phase shift is dynamically adjusted each round based on the cumulative payoff difference between rounds, with a small stochastic perturbation to prevent exploitation. This strategy introduces periodicity with tunable phase sensitivity, enabling detection of cyclic opponent behavior without relying on fractal or recursive dynamics.",
