During peak social hours (18:00\u201320:00), the probability increases to 0.70, reflecting higher coordination potential during evening gatherings. Outside of this window, particularly during early morning (06:00\u201308:00) or late night (22:00\u201300:00), the probability decreases to 0.30, as social alignment is less likely. This strategy leverages temporal patterns in human behavior instead of environmental signals.",
