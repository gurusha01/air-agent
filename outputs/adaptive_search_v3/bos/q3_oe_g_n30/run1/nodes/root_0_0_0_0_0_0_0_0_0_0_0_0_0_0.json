  "strategy": "Implement a machine learning-based adaptive response strategy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a bidirectional architecture trained on historical move sequences. The RNN learns to predict the column player's next move by capturing long-term dependencies in behavioral patterns, and the row player then responds with a countermove that maximizes expected payoff based on the predicted action. The model is updated every 5 turns using online learning, allowing it to adapt to shifts in the column player's behavior without relying on periodicity or phase shifts. This approach treats the game as a sequential prediction problem rather than a rhythm-based one.",
