  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian belief-updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the column player's type (e.g., cooperative or exploitative) based on observed actions. Each round, the agent updates its belief using Bayes' rule with a prior that favors cooperation. The decision to cooperate or defect is then made by maximizing expected payoff under the current belief distribution, with a discount factor applied to future rounds to prioritize short-term stability. The model uses a hierarchical Dirichlet process to adaptively infer the opponent's behavior without requiring explicit sequence modeling.",
