  "strategy": "Introduce a weather-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts cooperation probability based on local humidity levels, modeled as a logistic function of relative humidity. High humidity (above 60%) is assumed to increase column player's sensitivity to cooperative signals due to social cues being more salient in moist environments. The strategy uses real-time weather API data to dynamically update the cooperation probability, creating an environmental signal that may bias the column player\u2019s response. This leverages environmental psychology and sensory perception to create an asymmetric influence on the column player\u2019s decision-making.",
