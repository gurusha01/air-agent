  "strategy": "Implement a weather-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing the \"same activity\" option based on real-time weather conditions. On days with clear skies and low precipitation, the row player sets a higher probability (0.75) to align with outdoor activities. On days with heavy rain or storms, the probability drops to 0.4 to avoid mismatching with indoor preferences. This leverages environmental cues as exogenous signals of the column player's likely activity preferences.",
