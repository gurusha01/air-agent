  "strategy": "Implement a time-delayed feedback strategy where the row player observes the column player's last move and then delays their own action by one turn, choosing the opposite of the column player's move. This introduces a controlled asymmetry that disrupts coordination patterns, forcing the column player to adapt their behavior. The strategy is grounded in temporal lag modeling and behavioral inertia, rather than entropy or belief updating.",
