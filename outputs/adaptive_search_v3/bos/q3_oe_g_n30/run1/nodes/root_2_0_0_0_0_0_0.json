  "strategy": "Implement a time-series momentum-based cooperation threshold strategy where the row player's cooperation decision is determined by the moving average of the column player's past cooperation decisions over the last 3 rounds. If the moving average exceeds 0.6, the row player cooperates; otherwise, defects. The threshold is dynamically adjusted each round using a reinforcement learning-inspired update rule: if the row player gains payoff from cooperation, the threshold is slightly increased; if payoff is lost, the threshold is decreased. This strategy leverages simple temporal momentum without relying on trigonometric or phase-shifted functions, focusing instead on behavioral inertia in the opponent\u2019s actions.",
