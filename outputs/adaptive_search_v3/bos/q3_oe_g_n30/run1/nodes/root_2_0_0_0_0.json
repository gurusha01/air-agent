  "strategy": "Implement a fractal-based adaptive strategy where the row player's cooperation decision is determined by a Mandelbrot-set-like iteration of the column player's previous moves. Each round, a normalized payoff history is fed into a recursive function z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, with c derived from the column player's action history (cooperation = 0, defection = 1). If the magnitude of z_n remains bounded after 100 iterations, the row player cooperates; otherwise, they defect. The fractal structure introduces self-similarity and sensitivity to long-range dependencies, allowing the row player to detect subtle, non-linear patterns in opponent behavior that static or periodic strategies miss.",
