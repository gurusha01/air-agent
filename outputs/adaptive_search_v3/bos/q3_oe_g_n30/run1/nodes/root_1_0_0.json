  "strategy": "Implement a temperature-dependent mixed strategy where the row player's cooperation probability is modulated by a simulated environmental temperature factor. The temperature is modeled as a stochastic process with daily fluctuations around a mean of 20\u00b0C, and cooperation probability increases linearly with temperature up to a threshold of 25\u00b0C, then plateaus. This introduces a physical-world analogy that may exploit the column player's potential sensitivity to environmental cues or perceived context shifts.",
