  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that learns through direct interaction with the column player. The agent observes the full history of moves (both players' actions) and receives reward signals based on the payoff of each action pair. Instead of predicting the column player\u2019s move, the agent learns a policy that directly selects a move (cooperate or defect) to maximize cumulative payoff over time. The state space includes the current round, the opponent's last three moves, and a reward history window. The policy is updated every turn using on-policy gradient steps with a clipped objective function, enabling robust adaptation to behavioral shifts without relying on sequence prediction or pattern recognition. This approach treats the game as a dynamic decision-making process where rewards are directly linked to outcomes.",
