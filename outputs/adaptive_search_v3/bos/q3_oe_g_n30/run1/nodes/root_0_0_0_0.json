During peak daylight hours (10 AM to 4 PM), the row player sets a higher probability of 0.7 to align with increased likelihood of outdoor activities. During evening and nighttime hours (6 PM to 10 PM), the probability drops to 0.3, reflecting a higher chance of indoor activities. This leverages temporal patterns as exogenous signals of activity preferences.",
