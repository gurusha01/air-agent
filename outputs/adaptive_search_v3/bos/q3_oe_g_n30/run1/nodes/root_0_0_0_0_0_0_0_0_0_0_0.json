  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic threshold-based strategy where the row player monitors the entropy of the column player's past actions over a sliding window of 3 turns. If the entropy exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold (initially set to 0.8), the row player switches to a mixed strategy that favors the coordination option (e.g., 70% chance to match the column player\u2019s last move). Otherwise, the row player commits to a consistent, predictable action (e.g., always choose \"movie\") to exploit perceived coordination-averse behavior. This strategy leverages real-time behavioral unpredictability detection without relying on probabilistic models or belief updating.",
