  "strategy": "Implement a time-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts cooperation probability based on the time of day (simulated as a cyclic variable), using a sine wave modulation. Specifically, the probability of cooperating increases gradually from 0.3 to 0.7 over a 24-hour cycle, then decreases symmetrically. This introduces temporal unpredictability and exploits potential asymmetries in the column player's response to timing patterns.",
