  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic probability adaptation strategy where the row player adjusts the selection probability of Action A based on the observed historical sequence of the column player's actions. Specifically, if the column player consistently chooses Action A in the last three rounds, the row player increases the probability of selecting Action B to 0.7, signaling strategic unpredictability. Otherwise, the row player maintains a baseline of 0.6 for Action A. This leverages behavioral forecasting and anticipatory signaling, exploiting the column player's potential for pattern recognition. The probability distribution is updated after every 5 rounds using a sliding window of past choices.",
