  "strategy": "Use a mixed strategy where the row player randomizes between cooperating (choosing the same action as the column player) and defecting (choosing the opposite action) with a probability based on a sigmoid function of the historical payoff difference. This introduces adaptive learning by adjusting the probability dynamically based on past outcomes, using a learning rate of 0.01 to smooth transitions. The strategy is fundamentally different because it incorporates temporal feedback and non-linear adaptation, unlike static or fixed probability strategies.",
