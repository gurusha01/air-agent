  "strategy": "Use a mixed strategy where the row player chooses 'Coordination' with probability 0.6 and 'Conflict' with probability 0.4, based on a simple time-series memory of the opponent's past moves. The model learns to adjust the probability dynamically by tracking the opponent's historical choices over a 3-period window, applying a moving average to update the strategy. This introduces a behavioral component that mimics adaptive learning in real-world interactions.",
