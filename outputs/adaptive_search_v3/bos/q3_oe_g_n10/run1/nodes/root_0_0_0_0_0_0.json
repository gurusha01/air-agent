  "strategy": "Implement a time-series autoregressive model (ARIMA) with exogenous variables (exog) to forecast opponent actions based on lagged historical choices, incorporating seasonal components and trend adjustments. The row player uses the predicted opponent action probabilities to select a counter-strategy that maximizes expected payoff, adjusting model order and seasonal parameters via grid search after every 5 rounds to capture evolving patterns. This approach leverages classical time-series methods to model temporal dependencies without relying on kernel-based non-linearity or probabilistic opponent typing.",
