  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based policy gradient strategy where the row player learns an action policy directly from interaction history using a deep neural network that maps state representations (including opponent action history, round number, and temporal correlation metrics) to action probabilities. The state representation incorporates temporal autocorrelation features (e.g., lag-1 and lag-2 opponent actions) and a learned embedding of opponent type via a clustering layer that dynamically identifies patterns in behavior. The policy is updated via PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with a reward function that emphasizes both coordination payoff and the frequency of successful coordination over time. This approach replaces the evolutionary population with a single, learning agent that adapts through experience, enabling real-time feedback and dynamic response to opponent strategies without explicit modeling of opponent types.",
