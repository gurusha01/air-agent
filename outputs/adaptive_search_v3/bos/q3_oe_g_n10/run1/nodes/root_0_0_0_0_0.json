  "strategy": "Implement a kernel-based Gaussian process regression model that predicts opponent behavior as a function of historical action patterns, using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel to model non-linear dependencies. The row player then selects actions that maximize expected payoff under a Bayesian posterior over opponent types, updating the kernel hyperparameters incrementally using online learning. This approach replaces neural networks with a probabilistic model that explicitly quantifies uncertainty in opponent behavior, enabling more cautious coordination when confidence is low.",
