  "strategy": "Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a GRU layer to model the opponent's action sequence as a time-series of discrete choices. Instead of sliding-window KDE, the RNN learns a dynamic latent representation of the opponent's behavior over time, capturing temporal dependencies and evolving patterns. The row player computes the expected payoff for each action using a learned policy derived from the RNN's hidden state at each time step. Feature engineering includes opponent action lag-1 to lag-5, round parity, and a time-of-day embedding (hourly binning) to enrich input signals. The model is trained on historical data using reinforcement learning to maximize average payoff.",
