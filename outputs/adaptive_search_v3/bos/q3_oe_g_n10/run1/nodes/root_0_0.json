  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player adjusts its action based on the long-term cumulative reward observed from past interactions. The agent learns a policy through Q-learning, updating the value of each action (coordinating or not) based on the opponent's response and the resulting payoff. The strategy uses a decaying reward function to prioritize consistent coordination when the opponent shows stable preferences, while introducing small exploration noise to prevent exploitation. This approach treats the game as a sequential decision-making process with feedback-driven policy refinement.",
