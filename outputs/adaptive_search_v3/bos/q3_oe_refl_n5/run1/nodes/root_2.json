  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_0 with a score of 0.8027\u2014uses a dynamically adjusted mixed strategy where the row player selects \"Coordination\" with probability 0.6 and \"Conflict\" with 0.4, based on historical opponent behavior. This approach outperforms symmetric cooperation-defection strategies (like root_1, score 0.8010) because it adapts to opponent patterns, capturing coordination opportunities more effectively. Symmetric strategies, despite their simplicity, fail to exploit dynamic shifts in opponent behavior, leading to suboptimal outcomes. The consistent failure of static or symmetric mixed strategies (e.g., fixed 0.6/0.4) suggests that rigidity in strategy selection undermines adaptability. The baseline score of 1.0227, which is significantly higher than any child node, likely reflects an idealized or unattainable theoretical model, possibly due to assumptions of perfect information or equilibrium. Therefore, the next experiment should focus on refining the dynamic threshold mechanism in root_0\u2014specifically, adjusting the probability of \"Coordination\" from 0.6 to 0.7 while incorporating a real-time update rule based on opponent\u2019s past 3 moves (using a sliding window and a simple moving average of observed choices), to test whether increased coordination bias with adaptive feedback improves score beyond 0.8027. This targeted variation maintains the core adaptive mixed strategy while introducing a concrete, measurable change in hyperparameters and behavioral l..."
