  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_0 with a score of 0.8027\u2014uses a dynamically adjusted mixed strategy where the row player selects \"Coordination\" with probability 0.6 and \"Conflict\" with 0.4, based on historical opponent behavior. This approach works because it balances exploitation of coordination (high mutual benefit) with adaptive resistance to defection, effectively learning opponent patterns over time without overfitting to short-term signals. In contrast, root_1 (0.8010) uses a symmetric mixed strategy with identical probabilities, which lacks adaptability and fails to exploit asymmetric dynamics in the game. Root_2 (0.3480) fails due to a poorly implemented real-time feedback loop with excessive noise and delayed response, indicating that overly complex feedback mechanisms without proper smoothing or thresholding degrade performance. The consistent failure of static or symmetric strategies (like root_1) shows that rigidity in probability assignment undermines responsiveness to opponent shifts. The next experiment should expand root_0 by introducing a **sliding window of the last 5 opponent moves**, adjusting the \"Coordination\" probability dynamically using a **weighted average with exponential decay (\u03b1 = 0.3)**, and testing a threshold of 0.55 for triggering a shift to \"Conflict\" when opponent coordination frequency drops below 0.4. This refinement directly targets the dynamic adjustment mechanism while maintaining the core 0.6/0.4 baseline, with a hypothesis th..."
