Specifically, if the opponent cooperated in the last two periods, the row player increases cooperation probability to 0.7; if they defected in the last two periods, it drops to 0.3; otherwise, it defaults to 0.55. This introduces temporal feedback and exploits potential learning or pattern recognition by the opponent.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_0 with a score of 0.8027\u2014uses a dynamically adjusted mixed strategy where the row player selects \"Coordination\" with probability 0.6 and \"Conflict\" with 0.4, based on historical opponent behavior. This approach works because it balances exploitation of coordination incentives with adaptive responsiveness to opponent patterns, avoiding rigid or symmetric assumptions. In contrast, strategies relying on time-dependent or inverse-round probability (e.g., root_0_0 at 0.4489) or real-time feedback loops (e.g., root_2 at 0.3480) have failed due to poor convergence and instability in early rounds, leading to low scores. Symmetric mixed strategies (like root_1 at 0.8010) perform nearly as well but lack the dynamic adaptation that fine-tunes probabilities based on opponent history, suggesting that symmetry alone is insufficient. The next experiment should specifically expand root_1 by introducing a *dynamic threshold adjustment*\u2014for example, increasing the \"Cooperate\" probability by 0.1 if the opponent has cooperated in the last 3 rounds, and decreasing it otherwise\u2014while keeping the base probability at 0.6. This hybrid of symmetry with adaptive thresholds should improve score by leveraging both stability and responsiveness, and we should monitor the impact on round 5\u201310 performance with a focus on score stability."
