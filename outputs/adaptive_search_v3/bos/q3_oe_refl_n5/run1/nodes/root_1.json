  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_0 with a score of 0.8027\u2014relies on a dynamically adjusted mixed strategy where the row player selects \"Coordination\" with probability 0.6 and \"Conflict\" with 0.4, calibrated based on historical opponent behavior. This approach works because it balances exploitation of predictable patterns with sufficient randomness to avoid being exploited in repeated interactions, leveraging real-time feedback rather than static probabilities. In contrast, static mixed strategies (e.g., always 0.5\u20130.5) or purely reactive strategies (e.g., always mirroring opponent\u2019s last move) have consistently underperformed, yielding scores below 0.75, indicating they fail to adapt to long-term behavioral shifts. The failure of reinforcement learning models with default hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate = 0.1, discount factor = 0.95) suggests overfitting to short-term patterns or poor exploration. The next experiment should test a **dynamic threshold adjustment** where the row player\u2019s coordination probability increases by 0.05 per observed opponent coordination, capped at 0.7, using a sliding window of the last 5 moves and a learning rate of 0.01 to prevent overreaction. This builds on the success of adaptive thresholds while introducing a more responsive, data-driven calibration\u2014specifically targeting the gap between 0.8027 and the baseline 1.0227 by improving coordination prediction accuracy."
