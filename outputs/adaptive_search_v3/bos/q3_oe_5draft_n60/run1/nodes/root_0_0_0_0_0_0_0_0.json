  "strategy": "Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a GRU layer to model the sequence of joint actions, where the row player's action is determined by a long-term memory of the opponent's action history. Instead of using positional encoding or attention, the GRU maintains a hidden state that evolves over time by updating its internal state based on the observed action pairs. The model learns to detect patterns such as alternating behavior (e.g., Movie \u2192 Football \u2192 Movie) and adjusts its action choice to exploit predictability. The output action is selected via a softmax over the predicted action probabilities derived from the final GRU state, with the temperature parameter tuned to encourage exploration during early rounds.",
