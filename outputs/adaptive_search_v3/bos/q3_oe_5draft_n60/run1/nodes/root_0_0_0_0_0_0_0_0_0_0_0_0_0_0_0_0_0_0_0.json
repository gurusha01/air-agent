  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based predictive model with a Transformer architecture that processes the opponent's move history as a sequence of tokens, where each action is represented as a positional-embedded token. Instead of using lagged features, the model learns long-range dependencies across the entire history via self-attention mechanisms. The row player computes a context-aware action selection by evaluating the expected payoff under a policy derived from the Transformer's attention weights over opponent actions, with a focus on identifying patterns in action co-occurrence and temporal consistency. Feature inputs include action types, move durations, and temporal gaps, but are now embedded directly into the token space with learned positional and action-specific embeddings. The model is trained on a curated dataset of high-variance interactions, emphasizing non-repeating patterns, and uses a reward function based on payoff deviation from a baseline equilibrium.",
