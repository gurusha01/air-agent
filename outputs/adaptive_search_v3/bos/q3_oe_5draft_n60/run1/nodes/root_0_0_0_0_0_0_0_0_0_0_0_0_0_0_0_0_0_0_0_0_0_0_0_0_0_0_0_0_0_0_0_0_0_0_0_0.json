  "strategy": "Introduce a context-aware adaptive strategy using environmental state encoding: observe and encode the round number, time of day (simulated), and cumulative opponent deviation from expected behavior as features. Build a linear regression model that predicts the opponent\u2019s likely action based on these features, then set the cooperation probability to the predicted probability from the model. Update the model parameters incrementally using online learning with a learning rate that decreases logarithmically over time. This strategy shifts from purely belief-based updating to a feature-driven, data-rich prediction framework.",
