  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning with eligibility traces (ELT) framework where the row player learns a policy through online updates based on reward signals. Instead of modeling opponent types, the model tracks the temporal correlation between actions and payoffs, using a sliding window of past interactions to estimate the value of coordination versus miscoordination. The policy updates via a discounted reward signal, with eligibility traces allowing the model to credit actions that were part of a sequence leading to a high payoff. This strategy emphasizes learning from immediate and delayed feedback, adjusting behavior dynamically without assuming opponent types or using Bayesian priors.",
