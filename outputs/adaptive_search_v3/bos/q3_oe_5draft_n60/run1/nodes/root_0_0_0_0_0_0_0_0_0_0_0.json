  "strategy": "Adopt a chaotic dynamical systems approach where the row player's action selection is governed by a logistic map initialized with the opponent's previous move, with a time-delayed feedback loop incorporating the second-to-last move. The system evolves deterministically over time, and the action is selected based on the fractional part of the map's output, mapped to a probability via a sigmoid transformation. This creates a pseudo-random, non-repeating pattern that mimics chaos while remaining sensitive to opponent history, avoiding predictable periodicities. The strategy leverages deterministic chaos to generate high entropy without relying on quantum phases or probabilistic interference.",
