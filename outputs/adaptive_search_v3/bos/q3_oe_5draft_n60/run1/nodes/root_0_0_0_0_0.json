  "strategy": "Use a transformer-based model with self-attention mechanisms to encode the entire history of joint actions (sliding window of 10 moves) and predict the opponent's next move. Instead of modeling transition probabilities directly, the model outputs a latent representation of the opponent's behavioral state, which is then used to compute a weighted average of past moves to determine the current move selection. The row player selects Movie with a probability derived from the attention weights over the past moves, emphasizing high-impact actions (e.g., when opponent chose Football after a long sequence of Movie). This approach captures complex temporal dependencies and contextual shifts.",
