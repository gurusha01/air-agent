  "strategy": "Adopt a reinforcement learning-based policy gradient approach where the row player learns an action policy directly from observed opponent behavior using a neural network with a multi-head output layer. Each hidden layer encodes temporal dynamics via long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and the policy head outputs the probability of choosing 'cooperate' or 'fight' based on a learned latent representation of the opponent's state. The model is trained via on-policy updates using a reward signal derived from the payoff matrix, with exploration encouraged through an epsilon-greedy strategy that decays over time. Features are derived from raw action sequences (e.g., time between actions, action alternation patterns) without any clustering or feature transformation. The policy is updated after every interaction, enabling real-time adaptation without modeling latent states.",
