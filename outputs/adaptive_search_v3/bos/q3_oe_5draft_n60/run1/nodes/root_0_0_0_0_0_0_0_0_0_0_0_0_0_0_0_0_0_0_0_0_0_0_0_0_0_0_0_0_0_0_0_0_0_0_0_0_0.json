  "strategy": "Apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM units to model the opponent's action sequence over time, treating each round as a time-step input. The RNN processes historical actions and encodes temporal dependencies, using a sliding window of the last 5 rounds as input. The output is a predicted probability of cooperation, which is then used directly as the row player's cooperation probability. Features include lagged opponent actions, action differences, and round-specific noise (simulated as Gaussian perturbations). The model is trained with backpropagation through time using a sigmoid output layer and updates parameters online with a decaying exponential learning rate (initially 0.1, decaying by 0.95 per 10 rounds).",
