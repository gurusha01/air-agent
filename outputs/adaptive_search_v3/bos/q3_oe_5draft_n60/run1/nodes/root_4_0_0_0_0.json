  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning with exploration-exploitation via epsilon-greedy over historical play patterns, where the row player learns a policy that rewards consistent payoff outcomes over time. Instead of modeling types, the strategy directly learns a mapping from past action pairs to expected payoffs using a tabular Q-learning setup. The row player samples actions from a fixed set (e.g., \"cooperate\" or \"defect\") and updates Q-values based on observed outcomes, with a small exploration rate to avoid overfitting to early patterns. This approach treats the column player as a dynamic, unmodeled opponent whose behavior is learned through direct experience.",
