  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian reinforcement learning approach where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the opponent's strategy (e.g., a Beta distribution for cooperation probability), updated after each interaction using observed actions. The policy selects actions based on the posterior mean, with a stochastic component that increases as uncertainty grows. Feature engineering replaces time-series embeddings with a belief state that tracks the opponent\u2019s likely cooperation probability over time, and uses a recursive Bayesian update rule (like a Kalman filter) to refine estimates. The policy is adjusted to exploit known patterns of opponent behavior while maintaining adaptability to shifts in behavior.",
