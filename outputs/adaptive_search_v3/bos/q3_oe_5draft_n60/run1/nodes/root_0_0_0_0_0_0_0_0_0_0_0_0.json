  "strategy": "Implement a temporal correlation-based adaptive strategy where the row player computes a weighted moving average of past opponent moves (over a 5-step window) and selects actions based on whether the opponent's move sequence exhibits positive or negative autocorrelation. If autocorrelation is above threshold, the row player shifts toward the opponent's most frequent recent action; otherwise, it selects the action that maximizes expected payoff under a Bayesian belief update. This leverages time-series signal processing and statistical inference to detect patterns without relying on deterministic chaos or feedback loops.",
