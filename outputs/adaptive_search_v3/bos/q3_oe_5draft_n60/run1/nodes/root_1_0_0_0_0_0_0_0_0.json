  "strategy": "Implement a frequency-based reinforcement strategy where the row player tracks the opponent's action frequency over a sliding window of 5 moves. If the opponent's selection of a particular action exceeds 70% of the window, the row player responds with the alternative action with 80% probability. Otherwise, the player maintains a 50-50 split. This strategy uses only observed frequency data and applies a simple reinforcement rule without any temporal trend detection or clustering analysis.",
