  "strategy": "Introduce a reinforcement learning with curiosity-driven exploration using a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns action-value functions based on observed outcomes and reward prediction errors. The model is trained to maximize cumulative payoff over time, with a bonus reward for exploring novel action sequences (e.g., unobserved coordination patterns). Action selection is based on a combination of Q-values and a curiosity-driven exploration term derived from the entropy of the state-action space. This approach replaces the GNN and temporal point process with a value-based policy that learns from interaction outcomes rather than temporal event timing.",
