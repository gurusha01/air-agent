The row player updates their action based on a transition matrix learned from historical data, with rewards assigned for deviations from predictable patterns. The policy is updated using on-policy reinforcement learning to maximize expected payoff over time, with a discount factor of 0.95 to prioritize immediate gains while maintaining long-term adaptability.",
