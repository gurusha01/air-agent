  "strategy": "Implement a temporal autocorrelation-based strategy where the row player computes the autocorrelation of the opponent's past actions at lag 1 and lag 2 over a 5-round window. If the autocorrelation at lag 1 exceeds 0.4, the row player infers a strong pattern (e.g., predictable alternation) and responds with a fixed cooperation probability of 0.7. Otherwise, the row player uses a low-pass filtered version of the opponent\u2019s action history to generate a stochastic response with a 0.5 probability of cooperating, simulating a smoothed, adaptive response to noisy behavior.",
