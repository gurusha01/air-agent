  "strategy": "Implement a machine learning-based state-dependent reinforcement learning (RL) strategy where the row player uses a small neural network (e.g., a shallow feedforward network) trained on historical sequences of opponent actions and the row player's own prior moves. The model learns a policy that maps observed state vectors (e.g., recent move history, temporal context, session phase) to a probability distribution over actions. The policy is updated continuously using on-policy learning with a discount factor of 0.95, and the row player selects actions based on the learned expected payoff. This strategy treats the opponent's behavior as a stochastic process with hidden state dynamics, not necessarily periodic, and adapts in real time to deviations from prior patterns.",
