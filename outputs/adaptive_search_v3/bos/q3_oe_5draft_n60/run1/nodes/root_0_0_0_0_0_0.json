  "strategy": "Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to process the sequence of joint actions, where each hidden state captures the evolving \"opponent state\" based on the history of choices. Instead of relying on attention weights over past moves, the LSTM outputs a vector representing the opponent\u2019s current preference, which is then mapped via a softmax to a probability distribution over Movie and Football. The row player selects Movie with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the LSTM's hidden state in the \"Movie-preferring\" direction, trained using reinforcement learning to maximize average payoff. This approach explicitly models temporal dynamics through internal memory cells, enabling better tracking of shifting patterns than attention-based methods.",
