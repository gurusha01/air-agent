  "strategy": "Introduce a recurrent neural network with gated memory cells (specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory network with custom gating mechanisms) that dynamically tracks the opponent's action sequence and updates a belief state over time. Instead of using positional embeddings, the LSTM encodes the opponent's history through a state-dependent attention mechanism where each hidden state is fed into a small feedforward layer that predicts the probability of the opponent choosing a given action. The row player then selects an action that maximizes expected payoff based on the current belief state, with emphasis on detecting phase shifts in opponent behavior (e.g., transitioning from coordination to randomization). Feature inputs are derived from temporal clustering of actions and inter-move latency, processed through a learned gating function that controls memory retention. The model is trained with a bonus for actions that exploit known opponent periodicities, even when those patterns are non-repeating.",
