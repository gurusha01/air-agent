  "strategy": "Implement a Gaussian Process (GP) regression-based strategy where the row player models the opponent's move sequence as a latent stochastic process and predicts the next action using a non-parametric Bayesian approach. The GP learns the uncertainty in opponent behavior over time and assigns higher confidence to consistent patterns. The row player then selects actions based on the posterior mean of the predicted opponent move, adjusting their own action to exploit expected deviations\u2014e.g., if the GP predicts a high probability of the opponent choosing \"Left,\" the row player chooses \"Right\" to maximize payoff. Feature vectors include lagged opponent moves, session duration, and inter-move intervals, with a dynamic kernel that adapts to volatility in opponent behavior.",
