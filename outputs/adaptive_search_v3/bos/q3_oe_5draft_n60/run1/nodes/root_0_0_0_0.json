The LSTM outputs a predicted transition probability to the next move (Movie or Football), and the row player selects the move with probability equal to the predicted transition probability of the opponent choosing that action. The model is trained on historical data with a focus on capturing long-term dependencies in opponent behavior, beyond simple lag-1 patterns.",
