  "strategy": "Implement a random walk-based move prediction using a geometric Brownian motion model where the row player estimates the opponent's move sequence as a stochastic process with drift and volatility derived from historical move differences. The row player then selects the action that maximizes expected payoff under a Gaussian random walk assumption, adjusting the step size based on variance of past move deviations. This strategy uses no frequency domain or periodicity assumptions and instead models opponent behavior as a continuous-time diffusion process with adaptive volatility scaling.",
