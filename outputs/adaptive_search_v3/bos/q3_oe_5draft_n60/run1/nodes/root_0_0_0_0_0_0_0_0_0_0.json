  "strategy": "Implement a quantum-inspired mixed strategy where the row player selects actions based on a probabilistic interference model: each action is assigned a phase angle derived from the opponent's last two moves, and the final probability is computed via a complex amplitude sum. The interference effect amplifies payoff when actions are \"out of phase\" with predictable patterns, introducing non-classical unpredictability. This model avoids classical Markov assumptions by treating action selection as a quantum superposition, with measurement collapsing to a classical action upon observation.",
