  "strategy": "Use a policy gradient method with an actor-critic architecture (PPO) that learns directly from interaction outcomes, where the actor policy outputs the probability of choosing a given action (cooperate or defect) based on a learned representation of the opponent's history. Feature engineering includes embedding the opponent's past actions as a time-series vector, and incorporating a dynamic attention mechanism to weigh recent actions more heavily. The critic evaluates the expected payoff based on observed outcomes, and the policy is updated using gradient ascent on the advantage function. This approach avoids value-based Q-learning and instead focuses on learning a stochastic policy through reinforcement learning with on-policy updates.",
