  "strategy": "Apply a Kalman filter to estimate the opponent's underlying cooperation bias, treating the opponent's actions as noisy observations of a hidden state (e.g., their true preference for cooperation). The row player updates a belief about the opponent's bias each round using the Kalman filter\u2019s prediction and update steps. If the estimated bias is above 0.6, the row player cooperates with probability 0.7; otherwise, it cooperates with probability 0.3. This approach assumes the opponent has a stable but unknown preference, and the row player adapts to it in a Bayesian fashion.",
