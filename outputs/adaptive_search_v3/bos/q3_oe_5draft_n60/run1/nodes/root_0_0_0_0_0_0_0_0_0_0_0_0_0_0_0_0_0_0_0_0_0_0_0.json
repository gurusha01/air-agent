  "strategy": "Replace the LSTM-based temporal model with a transformer-based architecture that encodes opponent behavior using self-attention over action sequences. Instead of modeling temporal dynamics via recurrence, the transformer captures long-range dependencies and co-occurrences in opponent actions. Feature engineering focuses on extracting action patterns (e.g., run-lengths, frequency of cooperation/fight) and their temporal alignment, using a sliding window to create dense, static feature vectors. The policy head outputs a probability of choosing 'cooperate' or 'fight' based on a learned attention-weighted representation of the opponent's recent history. Exploration is maintained via a temperature-scaled softmax policy with adaptive temperature decay. This approach shifts from recurrent memory to parallel, attention-driven pattern recognition.",
