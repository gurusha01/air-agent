  "strategy": "Implement a frequency-domain spectral analysis strategy where the row player transforms the opponent's move history into the frequency domain using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), identifies dominant frequency components, and selects the action corresponding to the phase-shifted peak in the opponent's move cycle. If a dominant frequency is detected, the row player anticipates the opponent's next move based on cyclic patterns in the frequency spectrum. This approach treats opponent behavior as a periodic signal, enabling phase-based prediction and avoiding autocorrelation assumptions. The strategy is fundamentally distinct from time-domain autocorrelation and Bayesian updating.",
