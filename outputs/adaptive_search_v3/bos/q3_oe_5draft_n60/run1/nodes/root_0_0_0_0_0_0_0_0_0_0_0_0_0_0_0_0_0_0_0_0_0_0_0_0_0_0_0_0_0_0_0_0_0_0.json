  "strategy": "Adopt a reinforcement learning with exploratory noise strategy: Each round, the row player selects cooperation with a probability derived from a moving average of past rewards, but introduces a stochastic exploration term that increases logarithmically with the number of rounds. This encourages adaptive learning without assuming a fixed opponent bias. The strategy uses a reward-based update rule where the cooperation probability is set to 0.5 + 0.2 * (reward_t - baseline_reward), clipped between 0 and 1. This avoids overfitting to a single bias estimate and allows dynamic adjustment based on real-time outcomes.",
