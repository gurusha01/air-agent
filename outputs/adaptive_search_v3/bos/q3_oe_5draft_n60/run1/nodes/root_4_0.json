  "strategy": "Adopt a dynamic adaptive strategy where the row player adjusts their mixed strategy based on the observed sequence of column player actions over time. If the column player consistently chooses action A (e.g., football), the row player increases the probability of choosing action B (e.g., opera) to 0.7, and vice versa. This creates a learning-based response that exploits behavioral patterns, assuming the column player has a slight preference or habit. The initial mixed strategy is set to 0.55 for both actions, and the probability is updated every 3 rounds using a simple moving average with decay factor 0.3.",
