  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that models the interaction history as a dynamic social graph, where each player is a node and each action sequence forms an edge with temporal weights. The GNN aggregates neighborhood information to capture complex, non-linear dependencies between players' past choices, treating cooperation and fight as labeled nodes with embedded attributes. Feature engineering includes edge types (cooperate-cooperate, fight-fight, etc.) and edge timestamps, enabling the model to detect structural patterns like cliques or anti-cliques in behavior. The policy head outputs a probability based on the learned node embedding of the current state, using a graph attention mechanism to prioritize recent interactions. Exploration is controlled via episodic entropy regularization and a fixed temperature of 1.5.",
