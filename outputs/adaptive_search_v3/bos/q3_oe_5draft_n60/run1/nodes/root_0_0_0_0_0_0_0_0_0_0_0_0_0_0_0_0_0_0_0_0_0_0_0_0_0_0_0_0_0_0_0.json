  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic threshold-based adaptation strategy where the row player monitors the opponent's action sequence and calculates the entropy of the observed actions over a 3-round sliding window. If the entropy exceeds 0.8, the row player assumes high unpredictability and adopts a mixed strategy with a 0.6 probability of cooperating; otherwise, it detects a low-entropy pattern and copies the opponent's previous two actions with a 0.3 probability of defecting to introduce noise. This strategy uses information-theoretic features to distinguish between structured and random behavior.",
