  "strategy": "Implement a time-series autoregressive strategy where the row player predicts the column player's next move using a simple lag-1 autoregressive model trained on historical joint actions. The row player then randomizes between \"Movie\" and \"Football\" with a probability derived from the predicted transition probability: if the model forecasts a 70% chance of \"Movie\", the row player selects \"Movie\" with probability 0.7; otherwise, they select \"Football\" with the complementary probability. This strategy uses sequential dependence modeling, treating the game as a Markov process with learned transition dynamics.",
