  "strategy": "Replace the GNN with a temporal point process model that treats each action as an event in a continuous-time stochastic process. The model learns the latent intensity function of cooperation or fight based on time-since-last-action, player-specific baselines, and interaction frequency. Instead of graph edges, the model uses event timing and inter-event durations as features, with a hidden state updated via a recurrent neural network (RNN) that captures temporal dependencies. The policy output is derived from a softmax over the predicted intensity of each action, conditioned on recent event history. This approach focuses on temporal dynamics rather than structural graph patterns, enabling more responsive and adaptive behavior.",
