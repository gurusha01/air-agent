  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include implementing reinforcement learning using a Q-learning algorithm with epsilon-greedy exploration (score: 0.9213), as well as switching to a reinforcement learning approach using deep Q-learning to train the row player's strategies (score: 0.9181). These methods have shown promise in improving the score compared to other approaches like genetic algorithms or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include implementing reinforcement learning using deep Q-networks with experience replay (FAIL). Additionally, some experiments involving genetic algorithms have not yielded significant improvements over baseline scores.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring a hybrid approach that combines elements of both Q-learning and MCTS. Specifically, we can use Q-learning to iteratively update the row player's strategy based on observed outcomes while also incorporating MCTS to balance exploration and exploitation. This could potentially lead to even higher scores than the current best. We can start with a moderate number of iterations for Q-learning and gradually increase it while fine-tuning the parameters of the MCTS algorithm, such as the number of simulations and the exploration constant."
