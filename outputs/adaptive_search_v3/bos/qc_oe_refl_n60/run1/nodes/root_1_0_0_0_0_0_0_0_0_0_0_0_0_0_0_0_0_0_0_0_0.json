  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include implementing reinforcement learning using Q-learning algorithms with epsilon-greedy exploration (score: 0.9213), genetic algorithms to evolve strategies iteratively (scores: 0.9202, 0.9202, 0.9190), and switching to deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch (score: 0.9181). These methods have shown promise in improving the score by leveraging advanced optimization techniques and machine learning capabilities.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include using reinforcement learning with deep Q-networks with experience replay (score: FAIL). Additionally, some experiments involving iterative deepening search with alpha-beta pruning did not yield significant improvements (score: 0.7239).\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring the integration of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within the reinforcement learning framework. PPO is known for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, which could lead to higher scores. Specifically, we can use a neural network as the policy function and fine-tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate, clip range, and number of epochs. This approach builds upon the successful implementations of Q-learning and genetic algorithms while addressing some of the limitations encountered in previous experiments."
