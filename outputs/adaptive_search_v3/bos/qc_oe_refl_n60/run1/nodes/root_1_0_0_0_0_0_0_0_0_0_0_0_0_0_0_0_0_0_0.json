  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include implementing reinforcement learning using a Q-learning algorithm with epsilon-greedy exploration (score: 0.9213), using a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies iteratively (scores ranging from 0.9202 to 0.9155), and switching to a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural network-based policy functions (scores ranging from 0.9181 to 0.9155). These methods have shown consistent improvement in the score compared to the baseline.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include using reinforcement learning with deep Q-networks with experience replay (score: FAIL), which indicates issues with implementation or configuration. Additionally, some experiments involving iterative deepening search with alpha-beta pruning did not yield significant improvements beyond other methods.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring the integration of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a reinforcement learning framework. PPO is known for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, which could potentially lead to higher scores than the current best of 0.9213. Specifically, we could use a neural network as the policy function and fine-tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate, clip range, and number of epochs. This approach builds upon the success of neural network-based methods while addressing some of the limitations encountered in previous experiments."
