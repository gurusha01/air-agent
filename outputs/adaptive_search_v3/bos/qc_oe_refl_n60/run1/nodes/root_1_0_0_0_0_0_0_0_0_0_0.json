  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include those that leverage neural networks, such as deep Q-learning and deep neural networks with self-play training. These methods have achieved higher scores compared to traditional tabular Q-learning and genetic algorithms. For instance, the deep Q-learning approach with neural networks yielded a score of 0.9181, which is significantly higher than the baseline score of 1.0227. Similarly, the deep neural network with self-play training also showed promise with a score of 0.9244.\n\n2. Several approaches have consistently failed or should be avoided. One notable failure was the implementation of reinforcement learning using deep Q-networks with experience replay, which resulted in a FAIL status. Additionally, switching to a genetic algorithm without incorporating neural networks or other advanced techniques did not yield satisfactory results. It appears that while genetic algorithms can be effective, they may need to be combined with other methods to achieve competitive performance.\n\n3. Given the promising results from the deep Q-learning approach and the high scores obtained with neural networks, the next experiment should focus on refining these models further. Specifically, it could involve experimenting with different architectures within deep Q-learning, such as Dueling DQN or Double DQN, to potentially increase the score. Another direction could be to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the current deep Q-learning model to see..."
