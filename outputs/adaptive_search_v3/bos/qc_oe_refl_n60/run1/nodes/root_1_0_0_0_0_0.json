  "reflection": "1. The approach that has worked best so far is the genetic algorithm implemented in **root_1_0_0_0_0**, achieving a score of 0.9150. This method effectively evolves strategies over generations by selecting high-performing parents and introducing mutations, leading to significant improvements compared to other methods like Q-learning and MCTS.\n\n2. The reinforcement learning using deep Q-networks with experience replay (node **root_2**) consistently failed. This could be due to issues such as vanishing gradients, instability during training, or insufficient exploration-exploitation balance.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring a hybrid approach combining elements of both genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning. Specifically, we can use the genetic algorithm to evolve initial strategies and then fine-tune these strategies using a reinforcement learning algorithm like Q-learning or policy gradient methods. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both techniques\u2014genetic algorithms' ability to explore a large solution space and reinforcement learning's effectiveness in refining and optimizing strategies based on feedback. By starting with evolved strategies and applying reinforcement learning, we aim to achieve even higher scores while maintaining robustness and adaptability."
