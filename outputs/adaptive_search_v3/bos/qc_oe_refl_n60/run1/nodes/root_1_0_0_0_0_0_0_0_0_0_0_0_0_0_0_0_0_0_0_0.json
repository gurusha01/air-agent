  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include implementing reinforcement learning with neural networks (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with a score of 0.9190), as well as using genetic algorithms to evolve strategies iteratively (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with a score of 0.9202). These methods have shown promise in improving the score compared to the baseline and other approaches.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include those that rely solely on Q-learning without neural networks (e.g., root_0 with a score of 0.7692) and those that implement deep Q-networks with experience replay but fail (e.g., root_2). Additionally, switching frameworks without significant improvements (e.g., root_1_0 with a score of 0.7244) may not yield substantial gains.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning with neural networks and incorporating elements of genetic algorithms. Specifically, we could use a neural network to approximate the Q-function while periodically introducing genetic mutations to explore new strategies. This could help balance exploitation and exploration, potentially leading to higher scores than the current best (0.9213). We should also consider tuning hyperparameters such as the mutation rate, crossover probability, and learning rate to optimize performance."
