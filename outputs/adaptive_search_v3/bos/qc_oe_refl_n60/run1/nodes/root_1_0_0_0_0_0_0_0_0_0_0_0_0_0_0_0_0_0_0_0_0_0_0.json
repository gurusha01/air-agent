  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include implementing reinforcement learning with neural networks (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with a score of 0.9155), incorporating genetic algorithms into reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with a score of 0.9113), and using deep neural networks with self-play training (root_1_0 with a score of 0.7244). These methods have shown promise in improving the score by leveraging complex models and adaptive strategies.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include using deep Q-networks with experience replay (FAIL node), which did not yield any meaningful results. Additionally, switching to a different framework without significant improvements (e.g., root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with a score of 0.9151 compared to root_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 with a score of 0.9155) may not be beneficial if they do not offer substantial enhancements.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring the integration of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a reinforcement learning framework. PPO is known for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, which could lead to improved performance. Specifically, we could use a neural network as the policy function and fine-tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate, clip range, and number of epochs. This approach builds upon the succe..."
