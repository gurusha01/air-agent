  "strategy": "Introduce a dynamic position-encoding scaling factor that modulates the magnitude of the position-encoding vector based on the agent's distance to the goal. For instance, when the agent is close to the goal, the position-encoding is scaled down to reduce over-attention to peripheral or irrelevant areas, while when far from the goal, it is scaled up to enhance attention to global spatial cues. This scaling is learned jointly with the attention mechanism and applied per episode step, using a learned distance-to-goal function derived from the agent's position and goal coordinates. This variation prevents premature focus on local features when the agent is distant from the goal, promoting more efficient path planning.",
