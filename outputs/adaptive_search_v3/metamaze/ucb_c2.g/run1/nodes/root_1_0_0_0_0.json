  "strategy": "Introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture using a curiosity-driven exploration module with intrinsic reward derived from environmental entropy. The agent is trained with a hierarchical policy that decomposes navigation into sub-tasks (e.g., \"reach nearest intersection\", \"align with goal direction\"), each guided by a separate low-level policy. The intrinsic reward is computed based on the entropy of the agent's state-action distribution, encouraging exploration of novel regions while preserving path efficiency. This approach shifts focus from path consistency to structural discovery, allowing the agent to learn more robust and adaptive navigation strategies through intrinsic motivation.",
