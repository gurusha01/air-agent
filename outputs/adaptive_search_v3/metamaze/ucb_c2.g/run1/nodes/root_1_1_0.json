  "strategy": "Introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework where the environment is decomposed into a sequence of high-level goals (e.g., \"reach exit from left corridor\", \"navigate to center zone\"), and the agent learns to first select a goal, then execute a sub-policy to achieve it. The HRL structure uses a goal-conditioned policy with a separate value function for each goal, trained via PPO with reward shaping based on goal completion. This encourages the agent to learn modular, reusable navigation strategies that generalize across maze variations, reducing the need for fine-tuning on specific layouts. The goal embeddings are learned via a Siamese network that compares goal trajectories and rewards, enabling better generalization.",
