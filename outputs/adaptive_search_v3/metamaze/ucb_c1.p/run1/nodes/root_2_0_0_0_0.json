  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-based terrain perturbation module that dynamically modifies the maze layout (e.g., randomly shifting walls or introducing temporary obstacles) during training, with the goal distribution adjusted to favor regions that are currently unreachable due to these perturbations. This forces the agent to learn robust path planning under dynamic environmental changes, improving generalization to unseen configurations. The perturbations are scaled based on the agent's success rate: high success rates trigger larger, more complex disturbances to challenge the agent, while low success rates result in smaller, localized changes to guide exploration.",
