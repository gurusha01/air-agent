  "strategy": "Replace the Transformer-based policy with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that models the maze as a graph where each cell is a node and edges exist between adjacent cells. The GNN processes the spatial topology to learn path-aware representations, with message-passing layers enabling the agent to reason about connectivity and long-range path planning. Introduce a dynamic edge weighting scheme based on observed path smoothness during training to encourage efficient traversal. Train using the same reward shaping, but add a regularization term that penalizes high node degree variance to prevent overfitting to local loops.",
