  "strategy": "Introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) layer to process the maze as a 2D grid image, where each cell is represented as a grayscale intensity based on its type (wall, empty, goal). The CNN extracts spatial patterns and edge information directly from the visual layout, then outputs a probabilistic goal prediction map. This approach leverages image-like features to capture local and global spatial structures, offering a fundamentally different feature representation compared to graph-based or transformer-based methods. The low-level PPO agent receives goal probabilities from the CNN, enabling more robust and visually grounded navigation.",
