  "strategy": "Introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that models the physical dynamics of the ship's structure and environmental conditions (e.g., ship stability, deck load distribution, water temperature) as continuous functions over time. By embedding physical constraints (e.g., weight distribution, buoyancy changes, structural stress) into the loss function, the model learns survival probabilities that align with known physical behaviors during the sinking. Survival is then predicted based on a passenger's proximity to high-stress zones (e.g., lower decks, engine rooms) and their estimated movement patterns derived from physical models.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (0.9545) and contrastive learning or GNNs on social relationships (0.9306), indicating that latent representation learning\u2014especially via autoencoders\u2014effectively captures non-linear patterns in passenger data. The high score of 0.9545 from the deep autoencoder + logistic regression suggests that raw feature transformations into meaningful latent spaces significantly outperform traditional tree-based models, even when the final classifier is shallow.  \n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like dynamic GNNs, temporal graph networks (TGN), and transformer-based sequence modeling have consistently failed (e.g., 0.9306 \u2192 FAIL), likely due to data sparsity, lack of temporal structure in the dataset, or overfitting on synthetic or noisy interaction graphs. Similarly, contrastive learning and time-series transformers failed due to poor label alignment or insufficient similarity metrics, suggesting these methods require strong supervision or pre-defined positive/negative pairs\u2014conditions not met in the Titanic dataset.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1** (score: 0.9306) by introducing a **lightweight autoencoder with shared latent space for categorical and continuous features**, using embeddings for categorical variables (e.g., Pclass, Embarked) and reconstructing continuous features (e.g., Age, Fare) to learn invariant representations. This maintains the su..."
