  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) with a dynamic edge-based model that represents passengers as nodes and their social interactions (e.g., family membership, cabin proximity, shared deck) as time-varying edges. The GNN learns survival probabilities by propagating information through these evolving social networks, capturing how survival is influenced by real-time social dynamics during the evacuation. Unlike LSTM, which sequences passengers temporally, this approach models relational dependencies and emergent group behaviors such as family clusters prioritizing survival.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing strategies so far\u2014achieving a score of **0.9306**\u2014involve advanced representation learning techniques such as deep autoencoders and contrastive learning, which effectively capture latent, invariant patterns in passenger features. These models outperform traditional ensembles because they learn richer, more robust representations that go beyond simple feature engineering, especially in handling complex interactions between categorical and continuous variables.  \n\n2. Approaches involving time-series modeling (e.g., boarding order) and GNNs with social interaction graphs have not yielded improvements and may fail due to the absence of meaningful temporal or social dependencies in the Titanic dataset. Similarly, experiments with random forests or basic neural networks without proper handling of categorical features (e.g., root_2_0_0_0) have failed or underperformed, indicating that poor feature encoding or lack of structured representation learning leads to suboptimal results.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand on the **contrastive learning framework** (root_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0) by explicitly designing a SimCLR-like pipeline where passenger features are augmented via small perturbations (e.g., random shifts in age or fare) and encoded into a shared latent space. The model should then use a logistic regression classifier on the contrastive embeddings, with a focus on preserving survival-class separability. This builds directly on the 0.9306 baseline and lev..."
