  "reflection": "The best-performing strategy so far\u2014root_2 with XGBoost, target encoding for *Embarked* and *Pclass*, and interaction terms\u2014achieved a strong score of 0.8756, indicating that gradient boosting with principled categorical encoding and feature interactions effectively captures complex survival patterns. This outperforms both neural networks (root_2_0: 0.8636) and random forests (root_2_0_0: 0.6555), suggesting that deep models struggle with structured tabular data without sufficient feature engineering or data size. Random forests with permutation importance selection failed to improve performance, likely due to overfitting on noisy or low-variance features. Neural networks, despite their flexibility, underperformed (0.8636 vs. 0.8756), possibly due to poor handling of categorical variables without explicit encoding or normalization. The consistent failure of unstructured or overly complex models (e.g., deep networks without proper preprocessing) highlights that simpler, well-engineered tree-based models with interaction terms are more robust. The next experiment should expand root_2_0_0 by replacing the random forest with a gradient-boosted model (e.g., LightGBM) and applying *target encoding with smoothing* to *Sex*, *Pclass*, and *Embarked*, while introducing *interaction terms between Pclass and Age* and *SibSp and Fare*, based on prior success in root_2. This targeted refinement leverages proven techniques while addressing the weak performance in root_2_0_0 through better ..."
