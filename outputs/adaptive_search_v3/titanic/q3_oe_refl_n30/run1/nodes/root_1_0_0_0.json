Instead of target encoding, use group-based encoding where each category is represented by the median survival rate of its group. Apply a grid search to optimize the C and gamma hyperparameters using cross-validation on a stratified dataset. This approach leverages kernel-based decision boundaries to capture non-linear relationships in a way that is fundamentally distinct from tree-based models.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep generative models (autoencoders and contrastive learning) and advanced tree-based ensembles with feature engineering, achieving scores of **0.9306**\u2014significantly outperforming baseline (0.7655). These methods succeed because they capture complex, non-linear patterns in passenger features and learn robust, invariant representations, especially when leveraging latent structures (e.g., social interactions or latent embeddings).  \n\n2. Approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNNs)** and **time-series modeling** have consistently failed (FAIL with 400 errors), likely due to data sparsity, lack of temporal structure in the Titanic dataset, or overfitting from synthetic edge definitions. Similarly, models with heavy reliance on unvalidated feature engineering (e.g., cross-product features without validation) or complex architectures without proper regularization (e.g., deep networks without dropout) show instability or poor generalization.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_0** (score: 0.8469) by replacing the random forest with a **deep neural network (DNN) using embedding layers for categorical variables (e.g., 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Embarked') and a feedforward architecture with batch normalization, dropout (0.3), and ReLU activations**, while explicitly incorporating **feature interactions via polynomial features (degree=2)** on key variables like 'Age' and 'Fare'. This builds on the success of neural networks wi..."
