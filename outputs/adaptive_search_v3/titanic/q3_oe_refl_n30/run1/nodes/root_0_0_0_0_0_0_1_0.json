  "strategy": "Introduce a contrastive learning framework where survival labels are used to define positive and negative pairs of passengers based on similarity in demographic and socio-economic features. The model learns a representation space where similar passengers (in terms of features) are pulled together if they share the same survival outcome, and pushed apart if they have different outcomes. A contrastive loss is applied to maximize the similarity within pairs and minimize it across pairs. This representation is then fed into a simple linear classifier. This approach fundamentally differs from autoencoders by focusing on supervised contrastive learning rather than reconstruction, and leverages relational structure in the data to learn discriminative features.",

  "reflection": "The deep autoencoder-based feature learning pipeline has yielded the best score so far at **0.9545**, significantly outperforming other approaches like gradient boosting (0.9306) or neural networks with standard architectures (0.9067), indicating that **latent representation learning** from raw features\u2014especially via autoencoders\u2014effectively captures non-linear, complex patterns in passenger data. This success suggests that **feature engineering through unsupervised learning** outperforms traditional tree-based or shallow neural models, which struggle with high-dimensional, sparse categorical features. In contrast, approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNNs)** or **time-series modeling** have failed (e.g., GNNs with dynamic edges: FAIL), likely due to data sparsity and lack of clear social interaction structure in the Titanic dataset. Similarly, **SVMs with RBF kernels** and **contrastive learning (SimCLR/MoCo)** have failed, possibly due to insufficient data for learning meaningful invariances or overfitting on small-scale features. The next experiment should **refine the deep autoencoder by introducing a denoising autoencoder (DAE) with sparse reconstruction loss** to improve robustness to missing or noisy data (e.g., missing age or cabin), and then feed the reconstructed latent features into a **shallow logistic regression classifier with L1 regularization** to enhance interpretability and generalization. This builds on the 0.9545 baseline while addressing potenti..."
