  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a deep autoencoder-based generative model to learn latent representations of passenger features, then use a logistic regression classifier on the reconstructed latent space. This approach captures non-linear dependencies through autoencoding while preserving data structure and reducing noise. Incorporate survival as a binary classification task on the latent embeddings, which are trained to separate survivors and non-survivors in a lower-dimensional space. This method introduces a fundamentally different architecture (generative deep learning) and shifts from explicit feature engineering to latent space learning.",

  "reflection": "The deep neural network with batch normalization, dropout, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables has achieved the best score of **0.9067**, demonstrating that complex, non-linear modeling with proper regularization and feature representation outperforms tree-based methods in this dataset. This success likely stems from the neural network\u2019s ability to capture intricate, non-linear patterns in continuous and categorical features, especially when combined with robust regularization. In contrast, approaches involving target encoding or categorical binning (e.g., root_2 and root_2_0) underperform, with scores dropping to **0.8756** and **0.8636**, suggesting that encoding strategies alone do not sufficiently improve model performance without proper integration into a strong base model. Notably, experiments introducing random forests or gradient boosting with interaction terms (e.g., root_1, root_0_0_0_0) yield lower scores (0.6220\u20130.6388), indicating that these models struggle with the data\u2019s complexity without deeper architectural or preprocessing enhancements. The failure of root_2_0_0_0 due to an LLM error highlights the risk of overcomplicating pipelines with target encoding and interaction features without empirical validation. Therefore, the next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0_0_0_0** by replacing the gradient boosting model with a **deep neural network (3\u20135 hidden layers)** that includes **embedding layers for categorical variables** (e.g., 'Sex', 'Embarked')..."
