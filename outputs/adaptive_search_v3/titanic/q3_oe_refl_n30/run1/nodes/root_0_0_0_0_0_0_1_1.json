  "reflection": "The deep autoencoder-based feature learning pipeline has yielded the best score so far (0.9545), outperforming all other strategies, including gradient boosting, neural networks, and ensemble methods. This suggests that latent representation learning\u2014particularly through unsupervised feature extraction\u2014effectively captures non-linear, complex patterns in the raw passenger data that traditional models miss. In contrast, approaches involving contrastive learning, GNNs with dynamic edges, and SVMs have consistently failed (e.g., error 400), likely due to data sparsity, lack of sufficient positive/negative pairs, or overfitting on synthetic interactions. These failures highlight that complex, data-hungry models require robust preprocessing, sufficient data density, and well-defined similarity metrics. The next experiment should expand on the autoencoder\u2019s success by introducing a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** with a sparse reconstruction loss to improve robustness to missing or noisy features (e.g., missing age or cabin), and then feed the reconstructed latent vectors into a **shallow logistic regression classifier with L1 regularization** to prevent overfitting. This maintains the high performance of the original pipeline while enhancing generalization on incomplete data\u2014critical in the Titanic dataset where many features are missing. The strategy should be tested with a strict validation split and feature importance analysis to ensure the latent representations are meaningful..."
