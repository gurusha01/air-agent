These features are derived from the original dataset through group-by operations and are fed directly into the tree-based model. This approach leverages the interpretability and strong performance on tabular data with complex non-linear interactions, while avoiding any sequence or graph-based modeling.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (0.9545) and contrastive learning or GNNs on social relationships (0.9306), indicating that latent representation learning\u2014especially through structured feature disentanglement or relational modeling\u2014effectively captures complex, non-linear patterns in passenger data. The high score of 0.9545 from the deep autoencoder pipeline suggests that reconstructing latent representations from raw features and then classifying on the reconstruction error or latent space is particularly effective, likely because it learns robust, compressed representations that preserve survival-relevant patterns.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like dynamic GNNs, transformer-based sequence modeling on structured events, and contrastive learning with survival-based positive/negative pairs have consistently failed (all with error 400), likely due to data sparsity, lack of sufficient similarity metrics, or overfitting on small-scale passenger interactions. These failures suggest that such models require substantial data augmentation, well-defined similarity functions, or pre-processing steps that are currently missing or not feasible with the Titanic dataset\u2019s limited and sparse structure.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0** (score: 0.9306) by introducing a **lightweight GNN with only familial edges (e.g., siblings, spouse, parent, child)**, using **node embeddings trained on a..."
