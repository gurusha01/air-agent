  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a neural network architecture using a shallow feedforward network (2-3 hidden layers with 64 neurons each) to model complex, non-linear interactions among features. Apply batch normalization and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. Use categorical variables like 'Embarked' and 'Pclass' through one-hot encoding, while encoding 'Cabin' using a frequency-based target encoder with smoothing. Introduce interaction terms between 'Age' and 'SibSp' and between 'Fare' and 'Pclass' as new features. Train the neural network with early stopping on a time-series split of the data to ensure robustness. This approach leverages deep learning's capacity to model intricate patterns not captured by tree-based models.",
