  "strategy": "Introduce a survival prediction model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns in passenger data, such as boarding sequence or time-of-day trends (e.g., inferred from ticket purchase timing or departure schedules). Feature engineering includes time-based encodings (e.g., day of week, hour of boarding) derived from metadata like embarkation port and ticket purchase dates. Preprocessing involves time-series alignment using sliding windows to simulate dynamic passenger flows. This approach shifts focus from static demographics to temporal behavior, modeling how survival might depend on contextual sequences rather than isolated attributes.",
