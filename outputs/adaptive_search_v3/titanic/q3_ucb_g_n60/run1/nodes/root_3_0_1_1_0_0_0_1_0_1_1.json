  "strategy": "Introduce a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) with hierarchical priors over passenger features (e.g., age, class, gender) to model uncertainty in survival predictions. The BNN learns latent distributions over survival probabilities for each passenger, incorporating prior knowledge about survival rates by class, age group, and gender. During inference, the model samples survival outcomes from the posterior distribution, enabling robustness to sparse data in subgroups (e.g., rare combinations of class and cabin). This approach explicitly handles uncertainty and provides probabilistic survival estimates that can be used to refine feature weights via posterior updates.",
