  "strategy": "Apply a graph neural network (GNN) with node embeddings to model passenger relationships explicitly. Construct a graph where each passenger is a node, and edges are created based on shared family members (sibling/spouse, parent/child, child/parent), same deck, or same class. Use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to propagate survival information across these relationships, allowing the model to learn contextual survival patterns through family and spatial dependencies. This approach replaces the sequence-based attention with a relational, graph-structured learning framework, focusing on direct interdependencies rather than implicit context.",
