  "strategy": "Introduce a deep autoencoder-based feature reconstruction approach to learn latent representations of passenger profiles, where the encoder compresses the original feature space into a low-dimensional latent space, and the decoder reconstructs the original features. The reconstruction error is used as a proxy for feature redundancy or missingness, and the latent space is then fed into a simple logistic regression model for survival prediction. This strategy leverages unsupervised learning to uncover hidden patterns in the data that are not captured by explicit feature engineering or tree-based interactions.",
