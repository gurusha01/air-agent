  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a random forest ensemble using 100 trees, with feature bagging and out-of-bag (OOB) scoring for evaluation. Apply target encoding to categorical variables like embarked and class, but use a weighted average based on survival rate instead of simple mean. Introduce interaction terms between age and class, and between fare and sex, by creating new features (e.g., age * class, fare * sex) directly in the feature space. Normalize only the continuous features (age, fare) using min-max scaling instead of standardization. Evaluate model performance using cross-validation with stratified splits.",
