  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a gradient boosting machine (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) as the first model to capture complex non-linear patterns and handle feature interactions more effectively than shallow neural networks. Then, use a deep autoencoder to reconstruct the original feature space and extract latent representations, which are then fed into a logistic regression meta-learner with L2 regularization. This introduces a dimensionality reduction and feature learning step via unsupervised pretraining, fundamentally shifting from neural network stacking to autoencoder-guided representation learning.",
