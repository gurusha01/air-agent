  "strategy": "Replace the transformer-based sequence model with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using carefully engineered categorical and numerical features. Instead of treating passengers as sequences, we perform feature engineering by creating interaction terms (e.g., \"class * age group\", \"sibling count * fare\") and applying target encoding to categorical variables like deck and port of embarkation. The tree-based model leverages non-linear interactions and handles sparse features efficiently, potentially capturing survival patterns through monotonic relationships that are difficult for attention mechanisms to model. This approach avoids the complexity of sequence modeling while focusing on interpretable, high-impact feature combinations.",
