Features are derived from time-based groupings (e.g., passengers boarding in the same hour or day) and interaction terms (e.g., family size \u00d7 class). This model leverages tree-based splitting to capture non-linear, high-dimensional interactions without relying on sequence or graph structures, offering interpretability and robustness to sparse data.",
