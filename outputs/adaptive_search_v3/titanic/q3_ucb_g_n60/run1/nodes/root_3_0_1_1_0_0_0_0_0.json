  "strategy": "Introduce a temporal graph network (TGN) that models the Titanic voyage as a dynamic event, where passengers are nodes and their interactions evolve over time (e.g., boarding order, movement within the ship). The TGN captures time-dependent survival patterns, such as passengers who boarded earlier having higher survival chances due to priority access to lifeboats, or those who moved to safer decks over time. This approach leverages temporal dynamics to improve survival predictions by modeling the evolution of passenger behavior and exposure to risk.",
