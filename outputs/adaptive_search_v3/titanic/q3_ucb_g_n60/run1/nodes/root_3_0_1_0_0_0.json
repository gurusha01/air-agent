  "strategy": "Apply gradient boosting with tree-based models (e.g., LightGBM or XGBoost) using target-aware splits to handle class imbalance. Instead of relying on neural networks, use structured decision trees that naturally capture non-linear interactions and handle categorical variables via one-hot encoding with automatic feature splitting. Introduce a stratified sampling approach during training to ensure balanced representation of survivors and non-survivors, which improves generalization on the skewed survival target.",
