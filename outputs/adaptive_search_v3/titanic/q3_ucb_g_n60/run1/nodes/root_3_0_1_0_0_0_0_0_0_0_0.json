  "strategy": "Replace the random forest with a gradient boosting machine (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using early stopping during training to prevent overfitting. Apply target encoding with lambda = 0.1 for categorical variables, but introduce hierarchical target encoding by grouping categories by passenger class to capture class-specific survival patterns. Add polynomial features of degree 2 for age, fare, and class (e.g., age\u00b2, fare\u00b2, age\u00d7fare) to model non-linear relationships. Use robust scaling on age and fare, and apply a Box-Cox transformation to fare to normalize its distribution. Evaluate with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and use permutation importance to validate feature relevance.",
