  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) with heterogeneous edge types, where nodes represent passengers and edges are explicitly defined based on observable social and demographic correlations (e.g., same family group, same cabin, same port of embarkation). The GNN learns latent representations by aggregating information across these structured relationships, capturing familial survival patterns and group dynamics more directly than self-attention over sequences. This approach leverages predefined, interpretable relationships to model survival dependencies, offering a more grounded alternative to latent attention patterns.",
