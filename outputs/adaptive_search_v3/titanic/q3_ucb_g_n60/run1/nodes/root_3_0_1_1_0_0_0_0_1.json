  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based model that processes passenger records as sequences, where each passenger is represented as a token, and the model learns contextual survival patterns by attending to co-occurring features such as class, age, gender, and cabin location. The model is trained with self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and interactions between passengers (e.g., survival correlations across multiple cabins or decks), treating the dataset as a sequence of related passenger events. This approach shifts from graph-based relational modeling to sequence-based contextual modeling, enabling the model to implicitly encode social and spatial patterns without explicitly defining edges.",
