  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based model with attention mechanisms that explicitly model passenger co-occurrence patterns in the ship's layout (e.g., same cabin deck, same row, or proximity in lifeboat distribution). Instead of relying on graph edges, the model uses spatial embedding of cabin coordinates and applies cross-attention between passengers sharing physical proximity to capture emergent survival dynamics from spatial clustering. This approach leverages positional and contextual information to infer survival probabilities based on shared environment, complementing social and class-based features.",
