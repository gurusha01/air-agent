  "strategy": "Replace the random forest with a gradient boosting machine (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using early stopping on cross-validation folds. Apply target encoding with lambda = 0.1 for categorical variables, but introduce recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select top 20 features based on model performance. Instead of interaction terms, use polynomial features of degree 2 for continuous variables (age, fare) and categorical variables (sex, class) via a polynomial expansion, then filter based on permutation importance. Apply robust scaling to age and fare, and log-transform fare as before. Use a stratified 5-fold cross-validation with evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy.",
