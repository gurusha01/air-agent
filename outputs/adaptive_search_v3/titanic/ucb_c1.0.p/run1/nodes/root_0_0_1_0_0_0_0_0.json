Apply target encoding for categorical variables like cabin and embarked, with smoothing to reduce overfitting. Use a stratified validation split and hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization to maximize survival prediction accuracy. This approach leverages tree-based models\u2019 ability to capture non-linear interactions without requiring explicit feature tokenization or embeddings.",
