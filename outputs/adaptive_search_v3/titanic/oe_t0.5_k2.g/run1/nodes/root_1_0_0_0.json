  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a random forest ensemble, using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to improve stability. Instead of one-hot encoding, apply target encoding with smoothing (e.g., lambda=10) to preserve class distribution in categorical variables. Introduce polynomial features of degree 2 for continuous variables like 'Age' and 'Fare' to capture higher-order interactions, while applying a log transformation to reduce skew. Use permutation importance to identify the most impactful features and prune low-importance splits during tree construction. Evaluate using stratified k-fold cross-validation with early stopping based on validation accuracy.",
