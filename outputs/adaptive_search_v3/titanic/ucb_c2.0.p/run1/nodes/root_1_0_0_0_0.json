Introduce embedding layers for categorical variables like \"embarked\" and \"sex\" to model high-dimensional categorical interactions. Apply batch normalization and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, and use a time-based train-test split with a holdout validation set to maintain temporal validity. Tune hyperparameters via random search with 50 iterations to explore the weight, layer depth, and activation function space.",
