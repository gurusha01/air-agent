  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a random forest ensemble incorporating gradient boosting as a meta-learner. Use bootstrap aggregating (bagging) on the original features, but introduce structured feature interactions via pairwise combinations of categorical variables (e.g., combining 'Pclass' and 'Sex' into new binary features like 'Pclass_Sex_1'). Apply target encoding with a smoothing parameter (\u03bb=0.1) to handle rare categories, and use a separate decision tree model trained on the interaction features to refine predictions. This hybrid approach combines ensemble stability with targeted interaction modeling, potentially improving generalization on imbalanced data.",
