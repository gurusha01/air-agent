  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosted tree model with a neural network architecture (e.g., a deep feedforward network) that incorporates batch normalization and dropout layers to improve generalization. Instead of hashing or target encoding, use continuous embeddings for categorical variables (e.g., passenger class, gender) and apply a combination of mean, median, and percentile-based transformations on numerical features like age and fare to capture non-linear patterns. Train the network with early stopping and use a small learning rate schedule to avoid overfitting. This approach leverages deep learning's capacity to model complex interactions in high-dimensional survival data.",
