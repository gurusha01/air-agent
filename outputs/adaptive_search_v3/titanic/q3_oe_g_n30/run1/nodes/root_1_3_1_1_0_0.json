Introduce time-based embedding features by converting 'age' and 'fare' into quantile-based bins (e.g., 10 bins) and then use one-hot encoding with a learnable embedding layer to capture non-linear interactions. Apply a log-normal transformation to the fare variable to reduce skewness before feeding into the network.",
