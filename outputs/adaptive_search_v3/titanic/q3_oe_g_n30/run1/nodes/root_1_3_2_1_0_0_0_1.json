  "strategy": "Replace the random forest with a gradient boosting model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using target encoding for categorical variables (gender, class, embarked) with a smoothing parameter to reduce variance. Introduce a time-series-like feature engineering approach by creating lagged features based on survival status (e.g., survival of passengers in the same class or age group) and apply a robust scaling of numerical features using quantile transformation. This enhances the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships and group-level patterns while reducing overfitting through smooth encoding.",
