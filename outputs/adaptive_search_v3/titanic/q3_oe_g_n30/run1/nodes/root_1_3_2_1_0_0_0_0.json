  "strategy": "Replace the random forest with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using targeted feature selection via recursive feature elimination (RFE). Instead of raw categorical variables, apply target encoding on gender, class, and embarked using a weighted average of survival status per group, then apply a polynomial feature expansion on age and fare with degrees up to 2. Introduce early stopping during training to prevent overfitting and use a validation set to tune learning rate and tree depth. This strategy leverages gradient boosting's strong performance on structured data with interaction learning while improving feature relevance through target encoding and feature pruning.",
