  "strategy": "Replace the random forest with a gradient boosting model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) and apply target encoding on categorical variables such as 'embarked' and 'sex' using cross-validation to prevent information leakage. Use a stratified k-fold validation scheme to ensure balanced encoding across survival classes. Additionally, introduce a custom feature: 'age_group_scaled' derived from quantile-based bins with normalized values, to capture non-linear age effects more effectively. This approach leverages gradient boosting\u2019s strong performance on structured tabular data and improves handling of categorical variables through robust encoding.",
