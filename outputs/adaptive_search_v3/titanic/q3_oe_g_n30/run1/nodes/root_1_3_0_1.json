Instead of categorical embeddings, apply tabular autoencoders to learn latent representations of the passenger class and sex combination, capturing non-linear interactions through unsupervised feature learning. Use dropout regularization and early stopping during training, and apply stratified sampling in cross-validation to preserve class balance.
