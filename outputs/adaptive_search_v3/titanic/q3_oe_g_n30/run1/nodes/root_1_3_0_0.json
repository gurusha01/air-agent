Instead of relying on tree-based models, use a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers of 128 and 64 units, activated by ReLU functions. Incorporate the passenger class and sex as a categorical embedding layer with 16 dimensions, followed by a dropout layer (0.3) to prevent overfitting. Apply data normalization via min-max scaling on numerical features (e.g., age, fare) and use a learning rate scheduler during training. Evaluate using stratified k-fold cross-validation with early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting on the full dataset.",
