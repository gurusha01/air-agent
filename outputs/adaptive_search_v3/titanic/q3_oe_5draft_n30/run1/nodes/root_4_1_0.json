  "strategy": "Apply a graph neural network (GNN) to model passenger relationships as a graph, where nodes represent passengers and edges encode familial or social connections (e.g., siblings, spouses, parents). Use graph convolutional layers to learn structural patterns in family groups, which may reveal survival dynamics based on social networks rather than individual features. Preprocess categorical variables using one-hot encoding with sparse matrix handling, and normalize continuous features via z-score. This approach captures relational dynamics that tree-based or deep learning models may miss.",
