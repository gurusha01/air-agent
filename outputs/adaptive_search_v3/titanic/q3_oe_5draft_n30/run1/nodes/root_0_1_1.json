  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based model architecture with self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies and interactions among passenger features such as family size, fare, and cabin location. Instead of treating features in isolation, the transformer will process them as a sequence, enabling it to capture complex contextual relationships\u2014such as how a passenger's fare interacts with their class and whether they were traveling alone or with family\u2014through attentional weights. Apply position encoding to structured features and use a lightweight feed-forward network with layer normalization and dropout for regularization. Train with a validation set that includes stratified sampling to maintain class balance and use a learning rate scheduler with cosine decay to improve convergence.",
