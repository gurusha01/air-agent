  "strategy": "Replace the DNN with a random forest ensemble using gradient-boosted decision trees with added feature interactions via polynomial expansion. Instead of relying on dense transformations, introduce second-order polynomial features (e.g., age \u00d7 fare, pclass \u00d7 age) to capture nonlinear interactions that may be missed in linear or MLP models. Apply recursive feature elimination to select top 20 features and use out-of-bag (OOB) scoring for model evaluation. This approach leverages tree-based interactions while maintaining robustness to noisy features and handling missing values through median imputation.",
