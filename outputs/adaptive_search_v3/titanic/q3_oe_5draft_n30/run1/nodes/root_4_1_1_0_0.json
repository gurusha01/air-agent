Apply recursive feature elimination to refine the feature set and incorporate target encoding for high-cardinality categorical variables like cabin and port of embarkation. This approach leverages powerful gradient-boosted trees with data-driven feature prioritization, offering superior predictive performance over random forests while maintaining interpretability through feature importance and partial dependence plots.",
