  "strategy": "Introduce a survival prediction model based on temporal dynamics of passenger movements using a recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. Treat the passenger boarding sequence and movement patterns (e.g., time of embarkation, cabin location changes, or observed movement during the voyage) as a time-series signal. By modeling how passengers move through the ship over time, the model can capture temporal dependencies such as group clustering during critical periods (e.g., before or during the sinking), which may influence survival outcomes. This approach shifts focus from static social graphs to dynamic behavior over time, offering a fundamentally different perspective from both spatial clustering and static graph structures.",
