The GNN learns how survival is influenced by relational dynamics\u2014such as passengers in close familial groups surviving together or dying together\u2014capturing non-spatial, interpersonal dependencies that traditional spatial models miss. This approach shifts focus from physical layout to social structure, treating relationships as a latent survival factor.",
