  "strategy": "Introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based survival predictor that models passengers as nodes in a social network, where edges represent proximity, shared cabins, or family relationships. The GNN learns survival probabilities by propagating survival signals through these relational graphs, emphasizing high-order neighborhood interactions (e.g., family clusters or group proximity to lifeboats). Survival is treated as a node-level classification task with graph-level supervision. This approach shifts from temporal behavior sequences to social structural influences, capturing latent group dynamics that may have been missed in behavioral paths.",
