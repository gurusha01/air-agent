  "strategy": "Introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that treats each passenger as a node in a social interaction graph, with edges representing proximity during boarding (e.g., same cabin deck, same group, or adjacent ticket holders). The GNN learns survival patterns based on social connectivity and group dynamics, such as whether a passenger survived due to being in close proximity to a survivor or being part of a high-survival cluster. Features are derived from spatial and group proximity data, including distance between passengers in the same deck and boarding time alignment. This approach captures unobserved social dynamics beyond temporal sequences.",
