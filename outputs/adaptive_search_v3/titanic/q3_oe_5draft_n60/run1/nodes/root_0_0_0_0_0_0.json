  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that models passenger relationships as a graph, where nodes represent passengers and edges encode familial ties (e.g., siblings, spouses, parents, children). The GNN learns relational patterns in survival outcomes, capturing social dynamics that traditional models miss. Features include passenger class, age, sex, and cabin location, with edge weights derived from family structure. Train using graph convolutional layers with residual connections and employ a survival-specific loss function that penalizes mispredictions for isolated passengers. Use temporal validation to ensure model stability over time.",
