  "strategy": "Apply a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., LightGBM or XGBoost) with structured feature interactions, where categorical variables are one-hot encoded with a frequency-based thresholding scheme to prune rare combinations. Instead of treating features as sequences, we use tree-based splits to capture non-linear interactions between passenger class, age, fare, and gender, while explicitly modeling missing values via a learned imputation layer. This method leverages the interpretability and robustness of trees to handle sparse data without overfitting, and uses early stopping and out-of-bag validation to stabilize performance on edge cases.",
