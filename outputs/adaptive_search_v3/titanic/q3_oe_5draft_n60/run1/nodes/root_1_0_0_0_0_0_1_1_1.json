  "strategy": "Introduce a Transformer-based Survival Prediction Model that treats the entire passenger manifest as a sequence of events, with each passenger's boarding time, cabin location, and social interactions (e.g., co-passengers, family members) encoded as tokens. The model learns long-range dependencies in the boarding sequence and uses self-attention to capture how early interactions influence survival outcomes. Instead of modeling relationships as a graph, it models temporal passenger dynamics as a sequence, leveraging attention to identify critical interaction windows (e.g., family clusters boarding together) that correlate with survival. This approach replaces the TGNN with a sequence-to-scalar model trained on event-based representations.",
