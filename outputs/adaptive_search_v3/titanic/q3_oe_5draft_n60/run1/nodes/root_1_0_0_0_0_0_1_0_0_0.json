  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that models passengers as nodes in a social network, where edges represent proximity or family relationships. The GNN learns how survival is influenced by social dynamics\u2014such as whether a passenger is in a family group, shares a cabin with a survivor, or is near a lifeboat during evacuation. Features include cabin layout, class, gender, and proximity to lifeboat positions, with edge weights derived from boarding records and passenger movement data. This approach captures emergent social behaviors that traditional models overlook.",
