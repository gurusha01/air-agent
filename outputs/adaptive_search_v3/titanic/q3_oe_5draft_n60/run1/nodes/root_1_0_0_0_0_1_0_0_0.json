  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based model with temporal encoding of passenger boarding sequences, where each passenger is represented as a token in a sequence based on their boarding group and time of entry. The model uses a learned positional encoding to capture the temporal order of events (e.g., lifeboat releases, crew actions) and applies cross-attention between passenger features and event sequences to model dynamic survival influences. This approach treats the survival outcome as a function of temporal context, not static graph relationships, and leverages self-attention to identify critical moments (e.g., ship listing) that affect survival probabilities.",
