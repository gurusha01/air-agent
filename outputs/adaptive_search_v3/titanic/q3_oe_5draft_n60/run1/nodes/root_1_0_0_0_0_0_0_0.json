Train the model with a focus on capturing non-linear interactions between socio-economic and demographic factors, leveraging the neural network\u2019s ability to model complex, high-dimensional patterns without relying on pre-defined strata or bins. This approach replaces engineered categorical bins with learned representations that can adaptively capture survival associations across the full distribution of data.",
