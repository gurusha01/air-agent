  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that models passenger survival based on social network structure, where each passenger is a node and edges are formed based on familial relationships (e.g., spouse, sibling, parent, child). The GNN learns how survival is influenced by social influence\u2014such as whether a family member survived or died\u2014using message-passing to propagate survival signals across relationships. This approach shifts focus from spatial layout to relational dynamics, using graph-based propagation to capture indirect survival effects not captured in spatial or temporal models. Features like age, gender, and class are used as node attributes, and the GNN learns to infer survival likelihood through relational patterns.",
