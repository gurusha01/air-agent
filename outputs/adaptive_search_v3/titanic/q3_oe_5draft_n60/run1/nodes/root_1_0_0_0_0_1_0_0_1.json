  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based temporal modeling framework with cross-attention over passenger boarding sequences, where each passenger is represented as a token in a sequence based on their boarding group, class, and cabin location. The model learns to attend to critical time-sensitive events (e.g., lifeboat releases, crew actions) that occur in a dynamic timeline. This approach captures both long-range temporal dependencies and contextual influences from events that happen before or after a passenger\u2019s boarding, enabling a more nuanced understanding of survival dynamics than TCN-based sequences.",
