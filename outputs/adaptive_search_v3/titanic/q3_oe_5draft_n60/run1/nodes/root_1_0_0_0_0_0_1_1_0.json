  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid of Self-Attention and Recurrent Neural Networks (SARNN) that models both sequential dependencies in passenger boarding order and real-time social interactions during the voyage. This model uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify key interaction events (e.g., group boarding, proximity changes) and fuses them with a LSTM-based temporal encoder that tracks individual passenger behavior over time. Survival is predicted based on the latent state of the passenger at the moment of the collision, derived from dynamic interaction patterns. This approach explicitly models both long-term behavioral trends and short-term event-driven social dynamics, offering a richer temporal context than static or purely graph-based models.",
