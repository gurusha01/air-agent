  "strategy": "Apply a deep neural network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers and non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to model complex, high-dimensional interactions between features. Use dropout layers for regularization, batch normalization to stabilize training, and incorporate categorical embeddings for 'sex', 'pclass', and 'embarked' to convert categorical variables into dense, learnable representations. Train the DNN with early stopping and cross-validation, and use a logarithmic loss function to optimize survival prediction. This approach leverages end-to-end learning of feature interactions without relying on tree-based splits or manual feature engineering.",
