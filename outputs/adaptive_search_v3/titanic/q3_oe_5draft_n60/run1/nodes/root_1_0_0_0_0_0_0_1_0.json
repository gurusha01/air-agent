  "strategy": "Introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model where passengers are represented as nodes in a social interaction graph, with edges defined based on proximity in cabin class, family membership, or shared deck. The GNN learns latent embeddings that capture relational survival patterns\u2014such as familial clusters or class-based social networks\u2014by propagating survival signals through the graph structure. Features include cabin proximity, family group connections, and shared deck assignments. This approach explicitly models social dynamics and interdependencies absent in time-series or isolation-based models.",
