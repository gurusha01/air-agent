  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a neural network architecture (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron) using a small, deep network with ReLU activations. Apply one-hot encoding to all categorical variables and perform standardization (Z-score) on all continuous features (age, fare) before feeding into the network. Introduce dropout layers to mitigate overfitting and use early stopping during training to prevent overtraining on the validation set. This approach leverages the neural network's ability to capture complex, high-dimensional non-linear patterns beyond tree-based models.",
