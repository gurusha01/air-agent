  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a neural network (e.g., a shallow multi-layer perceptron) and apply target encoding with leave-one-out cross-validation to reduce bias in categorical feature representation. Introduce non-linear transformations using log and square-root functions on continuous variables (e.g., log(fare), sqrt(age)) to stabilize variance and improve convergence. Apply batch normalization to the neural network layers and use dropout with a rate of 0.3 to mitigate overfitting. This strategy shifts from tree-based interactions to a parametric, non-linear model with stable encoding and robust normalization.",
