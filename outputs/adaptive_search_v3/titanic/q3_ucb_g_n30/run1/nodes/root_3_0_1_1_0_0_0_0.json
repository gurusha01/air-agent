  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) model to represent passengers as nodes in a social network, where edges are formed based on family relationships (e.g., siblings, spouses, parents/children). The GNN learns relational patterns such as \"passenger survived due to family group dynamics\" by aggregating information from connected passengers. Use node embeddings to capture both individual and relational features, then combine them with traditional tabular features in a final classifier. This approach explicitly models social dependencies that are not captured by standard tabular or deep learning models.",
