  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a gradient boosting ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using a carefully crafted feature set that includes target encoding for categorical variables (e.g., encoding class and gender via survival rates), smooth interactions between age and fare using kernel smoothing, and temporal features derived from the embarkation point. Instead of polynomial or PCA-based engineering, apply recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select the most predictive features during training. This leverages tree-based models' strength in handling non-linear relationships and interactions while benefiting from stable, interpretable gradient-based optimization.",
