  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which outperforms all others by leveraging latent representations from raw features like age, fare, and cabin. This suggests that autoencoders are effective at capturing non-linear, complex patterns in tabular data that traditional models miss. The high score also indicates that unsupervised feature learning can extract meaningful structure, especially when raw features are noisy or sparse.\n\n2. Approaches involving graph neural networks (GNNs), contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL), and hybrid models with autoencoders have consistently failed (e.g., **root_1_1_0_0_1**, **root_1_1_0_1_0**, **root_1_1_0_2_0_0**), likely due to data sparsity, lack of clear passenger relationships, or overcomplication for a tabular problem. Similarly, models with complex feature engineering (e.g., polynomial expansions, cross-products) or meta-learning (e.g., bagging + gradient boosting) have failed or underperformed, suggesting that overfitting or poor scalability in high-dimensional spaces is a risk.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_0_1_0_0** (score: 0.8612) by replacing the random forest with a **gradient boosting model (XGBoost)** and applying **target encoding with Laplace smoothing** to categorical variables like *Embarked* and *Sex*, while also incorporating **feature interactions via pairwise cross-terms** (e.g., *Pclass \u00d7 Sex*) derived from the or..."
