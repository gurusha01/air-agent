Introduce a custom feature: 'family_size' derived from 'SibSp' and 'Parch', and normalize passenger age into age groups (e.g., child, adult, senior). Use a learning rate of 0.05 and depth of 6, tuned via Bayesian optimization with 5-fold CV. This approach leverages gradient boosting's strong performance on structured data and improves feature interactions through smooth, non-linear transformations.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0*: 0.9474) and gradient boosting with target encoding (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0_0*: 0.8612). These methods achieve high accuracy because autoencoders effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin, while target encoding handles categorical variables (e.g., *Embarked*) by converting them into meaningful numerical predictors through group-wise statistics.  \n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like GNNs (*root_1_1_0_0_1*, *root_1_1_0_0_2*), contrastive learning (*root_1_1_0_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_1_1*), or hybrid models with autoencoders (*root_1_1_2_0_1*) have consistently failed\u2014likely due to data sparsity, lack of sufficient structure in passenger relationships, or overfitting in small tabular datasets. These models either fail to converge or produce poor scores (e.g., error 400), indicating instability or inapplicability to the Titanic dataset.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_0* (0.6435) by introducing **target encoding with smoothing (e.g., Laplace smoothing)** and **polynomial feature expansion up to degree 2** for continuous variables like *Age* and *Fare*, while maintaining a **gradient-boosted tree ensemble (XGBoost)**. This combines proven techniques\u2014target encoding for categorical variables and polynomial features for non-linear interactions\u2014into a simple, interpretable, and data-efficient pipeline..."
