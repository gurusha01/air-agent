  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a random forest ensemble where each tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the data, and introduce a novel feature: the distance between a passenger\u2019s age and the median age of survivors in their class. This distance is computed per group (class) and used as a categorical feature. Additionally, apply target encoding to categorical variables using only the survival rate of each category, and use a weighted voting scheme where trees are weighted by their survival accuracy on a held-out validation set. This approach leverages ensemble stability and group-level feature insights while maintaining strong interpretability through individual tree splits.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning in **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline and other models. This success stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin\u2014especially where traditional encoding or tree-based models struggle with high-dimensional or sparse categorical data. The model effectively learns compact, meaningful representations that improve downstream classification.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_0, root_1_1_0_1_0), contrastive learning (root_1_1_0_1_1), and time-series models (root_1_0_0_1_1_1_0) have consistently failed (all with error 400), suggesting these methods are either overfit, computationally infeasible, or poorly suited to the tabular, non-temporal nature of the Titanic dataset. Similarly, hybrid models with polynomial expansion or synthetic features (e.g., root_1_1_0_2_0_0) show diminishing returns and often fail due to instability or overfitting.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_0_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.6077) by introducing a **lightweight attention-based neural network** (e.g., a 2-layer MLP with self-attention over feature embeddings) that applies **target-encoded categorical features** (e.g., Embarked, Sex) and **normalized continuous features** (e.g., age, fare). Specifically, use a shared attention layer to dynamically weigh the import..."
