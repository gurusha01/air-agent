  "strategy": "Replace the autoencoder-based latent space with a contrastive learning framework (e.g., SimCLR or MoCo) applied to the raw passenger data. Instead of reconstructing features, learn meaningful representations by maximizing similarity between augmented views of the same sample (e.g., different random perturbations of age, fare, or cabin). Use these contrastive embeddings as input to a simple logistic regression classifier. This approach leverages self-supervised learning to discover robust feature patterns without relying on labeled data for supervision during representation learning, and it naturally handles high-cardinality categorical variables through embedding projections.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning (root_1_1_0_0 and root_1_1_0_1, both scoring 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline (0.7655) and other models like gradient boosting (0.7919\u20130.8589) or neural networks with shallow architectures. This success suggests that autoencoding raw features\u2014especially high-dimensional or noisy ones like *Cabin* or *Fare*\u2014effectively captures latent, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss.  \n\n2. Approaches involving complex or computationally intensive models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL) have consistently failed (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_1_0), likely due to data sparsity, lack of relational structure in passenger data, and overfitting on small-scale, unstructured features. These methods require dense, graph-structured data, which the Titanic dataset lacks, making them unsuitable without significant feature engineering or synthetic data generation.  \n\n3. The next experiment should refine the deep autoencoder by focusing on **denoising autoencoders (DAE)** applied to *Age*, *Fare*, and *Cabin* features, using a **3-layer encoder with 128, 64, 32 units** and **batch normalization** to improve robustness to missing or noisy data. The latent representations should then be fed into a **lightweight XGBoost model** with target encoding for *Embarked* and *Pclass*, using a validation split of 0.2 to ensure stability.
