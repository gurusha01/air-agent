Unlike the transformer-based approach, this method leverages tree-based splitting to capture non-linear interactions and hierarchical patterns in features such as class, age, and fare, while being robust to missing values and outliers. The model is trained with cross-validation and feature importance analysis to identify key survival predictors, offering a simpler, more interpretable, and often highly effective baseline for tabular data.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning in **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline and other models. This success stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to auto-extract latent, non-linear patterns from raw features like *age*, *fare*, *cabin*, and *embarkation*, effectively capturing complex, hidden relationships that traditional models miss. The high score suggests that unsupervised feature learning can uncover meaningful representations, especially in tabular data with mixed feature types.\n\n2. Approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, **contrastive learning (SimCLR, BYOL)**, and **Transformer-based tabular models (TabTransformer)** have consistently failed (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_1), likely due to data sparsity, lack of clear node/edge definitions in passenger data, and overfitting risks in small, imbalanced datasets. Similarly, hybrid models combining autoencoders with gradient boosting (e.g., root_1_1_2_0_1) or complex feature engineering (e.g., polynomial expansion) have failed, indicating that overcomplication without clear signal or interpretability harms performance.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the deep autoencoder framework in root_1_1_2_1_1 (0.8349)** by introducing a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** with *age*, *fare*, and *cabin* as inputs, using a sparse dropout layer to simulate noise and improve robustness.
