  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1* with 0.9474 accuracy) and gradient boosting with target encoding (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0_0* with 0.8612), indicating that latent representation learning and effective handling of categorical variables significantly boost performance. These methods succeed because they capture non-linear patterns in raw features and reduce data sparsity through encoding, which is critical in the Titanic dataset where categorical variables like *Embarked* and *Cabin* are sparse and noisy.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like GNNs (*root_1_0_0_1_1_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_0_1*, etc.) or contrastive learning (*root_1_1_0_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_1_1*) have consistently failed (score: 0.5933 or lower), likely due to data sparsity, lack of clear passenger relationship graphs, and overfitting on synthetic or non-existent social structures. Similarly, time-series models (e.g., LSTM/GRU) and hybrid models with polynomial expansion have failed due to the absence of temporal or sequential dependencies in the data.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_0* by introducing a **lightweight tabular transformer (e.g., TabTransformer)** applied to a **curated subset of features** (e.g., *Pclass*, *Age*, *Fare*, *Sex*, *SibSp*, *Parch*) with **target-encoded categorical variables** and **mean-encoding for 'Cabin'**. This combines the proven success of autoencoder-based f..."
