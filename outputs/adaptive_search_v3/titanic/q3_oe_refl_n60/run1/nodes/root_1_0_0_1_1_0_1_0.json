  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a lightweight gradient-boosted decision tree ensemble (e.g., LightGBM or XGBoost) using a custom objective function that incorporates survival probabilities as a weighted loss, with higher weights assigned to passengers in underrepresented subgroups (e.g., third-class children). This approach leverages tree-based partitioning to capture non-linear interactions and hierarchical feature importance, while explicitly modeling imbalance in survival outcomes. Feature engineering includes creating interaction terms such as \"age \u00d7 fare\" and \"class \u00d7 gender\" to capture synergistic effects. The model is trained with early stopping and regularization to prevent overfitting, while using stratified sampling during cross-validation to preserve subgroup representation.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1*, both scoring **0.9474**) and gradient boosting with target encoding (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0_0*, **0.8612**). These methods succeed because autoencoders effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like *age*, *fare*, and *cabin*, while target encoding handles categorical variables like *Embarked* by converting them into meaningful numerical representations that improve model generalization.  \n\n2. Approaches involving complex or computationally intensive models like GNNs (*root_1_1_0_0_1*, *root_1_1_0_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_0_2*) and contrastive learning (*root_1_1_0_1_1*) have consistently failed (all with error 400), likely due to data sparsity, lack of explicit graph structure, or overfitting on small-scale tabular data. Similarly, hybrid models with polynomial expansion or synthetic features (*root_1_1_0_2_0_1*, *root_1_1_0_2_1*) and deep attention mechanisms (*root_1_0_0_1_1_0_1*) show diminishing returns or instability, suggesting overcomplication without clear gains.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_1_0_1* (score: **0.8541**) by introducing a **lightweight autoencoder with a 2-layer encoder and 1-layer decoder**, specifically trained on *age*, *fare*, and *Pclass* to extract latent representations, then feeding these into a **LightGBM model with target encoding** on *Sex* and *Embarked*. This combines the streng..."
