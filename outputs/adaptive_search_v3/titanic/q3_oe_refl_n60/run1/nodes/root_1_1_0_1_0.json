This allows the model to learn robust, invariant representations of passengers by focusing on relative similarities rather than absolute values. Use these contrastive embeddings as inputs to a simple logistic regression classifier. This approach leverages self-supervised learning to extract meaningful patterns without requiring labeled data for the latent space, and can improve generalization in low-data regimes like Titanic.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning framework (root_1_1_0_0 and root_1_1_0_1, both scoring 0.9474), which demonstrates that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features\u2014especially high-dimensional or noisy ones like *Cabin*, *Fare*, and *Age*\u2014can significantly outperform traditional models. This success likely stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to learn compact, meaningful, and noise-resistant feature embeddings that capture non-linear patterns invisible to tree-based models. In contrast, approaches involving GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1 and root_1_1_0_0_1) have consistently failed with error codes (400), suggesting that modeling passenger relationships via social graphs is either computationally infeasible or poorly defined on the Titanic dataset due to sparse, weak, or unstructured interaction data. Additionally, experiments replacing gradient boosting with neural networks (e.g., root_1_0_0_0) or stacking random forests with gradient boosting (root_1_0_1) failed or underperformed, indicating that deep learning without strong feature pre-processing is unstable and less effective. The next concrete experiment should expand root_1_1_0_1 by implementing a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** with a 3-layer encoder and 2-layer decoder, using *Age*, *Fare*, *Cabin*, and *Pclass* as inputs, and applying **batch normalization** and **dropout (0.3)** to improve generalization. This variant should specifically focus on reconstruct..."
