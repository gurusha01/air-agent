  "strategy": "Replace the deep autoencoder with a transformer-based self-attention model applied to tabular data (e.g., TabTransformer), which learns global dependencies across passenger features like age, fare, and cabin through positional and feature interactions. Instead of reducing dimensionality via autoencoding, the model directly models complex feature relationships using attention mechanisms, then outputs a set of learned feature representations. These representations are then fed into a gradient-boosted tree model (e.g., XGBoost) for survival prediction. This approach leverages the transformer's ability to capture long-range dependencies in structured data, which is often missed by autoencoders and traditional encoders.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline and other models. This success suggests that autoencoders are effective at capturing non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin\u2014especially when the model learns compressed, meaningful representations that preserve survival-relevant structure. In contrast, gradient boosting models (e.g., XGBoost) perform well (e.g., root_1_1_0: 0.8589), but their gains plateau, indicating they may lack the capacity to model complex, high-dimensional interactions beyond what tree-based splits can capture.\n\n2. Approaches involving advanced or computationally intensive architectures\u2014such as GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_0_2), contrastive learning (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_1), or Transformer-based tabular models (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_2)\u2014have consistently failed, likely due to data sparsity, lack of natural graph structure, or overfitting on a small dataset. Similarly, experiments with polynomial feature expansion (e.g., root_1_1_0_2_0_0) or synthetic feature generation (e.g., root_1_1_1_0) either fail to converge or produce poor scores (e.g., 0.6244), suggesting that such engineering is not effective in this context.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_2_1** (score: 0.6244) by replacing the deep autoencoder with a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** trained on the raw features, using ..."
