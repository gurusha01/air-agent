  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosted tree ensemble with a neural network architecture using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with batch normalization and dropout regularization. Apply target encoding for categorical variables, but instead of using raw encoding, introduce a smoothing technique (e.g., lambda smoothing) to reduce overfitting. Perform feature engineering by creating polynomial terms up to degree 2 for continuous variables (age, fare) and encode gender-class interactions using one-hot encoding with interaction terms. Train the MLP using early stopping on a validation set and incorporate a simple latent space reduction via PCA (principal component analysis) on the original features before feeding into the network to capture global variance patterns. This approach shifts from tree-based non-linear modeling to deep neural networks with structured regularization and dimensionality reduction.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0*: 0.9474) and gradient boosting with target encoding (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0_0*: 0.8612), which achieve high accuracy by effectively capturing non-linear patterns and categorical interactions. The autoencoder strategy excels because it learns latent, compressed representations of raw features like age, fare, and cabin, enabling better generalization than raw feature engineering.  \n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like GNNs, contrastive learning, or time-series models (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_1_1*, *root_1_1_0_1_0*, *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_0*) have consistently failed (score \u2264 0.5933), likely due to data sparsity, lack of temporal or relational structure in the Titanic dataset, and overfitting on synthetic or non-existent relationships. Similarly, deep neural networks with complex regularization (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0_0_0*) fail despite theoretical promise, suggesting that tabular data with limited structure is not well-suited to deep learning without strong feature engineering.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_0* (0.5742) by introducing a **gradient-boosted tree ensemble (XGBoost) with target encoding and polynomial feature expansion up to degree 2**, specifically using *Pclass*, *Sex*, and *Age* as inputs. This builds on the success of *root_1_0_0_1_0_0* (0.8612) by combining proven techniques\u2014target encoding for categorical variables and polynomial..."
