  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) framework where passengers are represented as nodes in a social interaction graph, with edges defined by shared cabin class, family membership, or proximity in embarkation. The GNN learns relational patterns (e.g., survival likelihoods based on family ties or co-occupancy) directly from the raw passenger data. This approach captures latent social dependencies that traditional autoencoders or linear models miss, especially in cases where survival is influenced by group dynamics.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning framework at **root_1_1_0_0**, achieving a remarkable **0.9474 accuracy**, significantly outperforming the baseline (0.7655) and other models like XGBoost (0.8589) or neural networks with shallow architectures (0.7919). This suggests that autoencoding raw features\u2014especially high-dimensional or noisy ones like *cabin*, *fare*, and *age*\u2014effectively captures latent, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss. The success likely stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to learn compact, meaningful representations that reduce noise and reveal hidden structure in the data.\n\n2. Approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNNs)**\u2014such as modeling passenger relationships via shared cabins or family size\u2014have consistently failed (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_0 and root_1_1_0_0_1), with repeated LLM errors and no reported scores. This indicates either data sparsity (lack of clear social graph structure) or model complexity mismatch for this dataset. Similarly, **contrastive learning** (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) has failed due to technical errors, suggesting it's not well-suited to the small, tabular, and low-relationship structure of the Titanic dataset.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the deep autoencoder by introducing a denoising autoencoder (DAE)** to explicitly learn robust representations from noisy features like *cabin* and *embarked*, using a simple 3-layer encoder-decoder with ReLU activations a..."
