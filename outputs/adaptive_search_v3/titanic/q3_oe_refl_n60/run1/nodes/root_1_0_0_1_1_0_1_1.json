  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using target encoding for categorical variables, where each category is replaced by the mean survival rate of passengers in that group. Introduce group-wise feature interactions by creating interaction terms between class and age, and between fare and sex, then use tree splitting to capture non-linear, non-additive relationships. This approach leverages tree-based splitting to model complex, hierarchical patterns in survival, which are often missed by neural networks with attention, especially in sparse or imbalanced data like the Titanic dataset.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1* with 0.9474 accuracy), which effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin. These outperform gradient boosting ensembles (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM) with target encoding or feature engineering (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_1_0* at 0.8541), suggesting that autoencoders excel at uncovering complex, hidden structures in tabular data that traditional tree-based models miss.  \n\n2. Approaches involving graph neural networks (GNNs), contrastive learning, or recurrent models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs) have consistently failed (scores \u2264 0.5933), likely due to the lack of meaningful relational structure in the Titanic dataset\u2014passenger relationships (e.g., family size) are sparse and not inherently graph-based. Similarly, complex architectures like hybrid models with autoencoders or polynomial feature expansion (e.g., *root_1_1_0_2_0_0*) have failed, indicating overcomplication without clear feature interactions.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_1_0_1* (score: 0.8541) by introducing a **lightweight autoencoder with a single hidden layer (e.g., 32 units, ReLU activation)** to learn a compressed latent representation of the raw features (age, fare, class, gender), then feed this into a **LightGBM model with target encoding and feature scaling**. This combines the pattern-capturing strength of autoencoders with the robu..."
