  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a random forest ensemble with gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) and introduce a hierarchical feature representation where passenger class and gender are used as primary splits, and interaction features like \"age grouped by class\" and \"fare quartile by gender\" are built as categorical splits. Apply target encoding at the group level (e.g., encode survival rate by class-gender combinations) and use bootstrap aggregating to reduce variance. This approach leverages ensemble methods' robustness to noise and their natural handling of feature interactions without requiring complex architecture.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which demonstrates that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features like age, fare, and cabin significantly improves accuracy by capturing non-linear, complex patterns invisible to traditional models. This outperforms both gradient boosting and neural networks with standard architectures, suggesting that unsupervised feature learning can uncover meaningful, high-dimensional signal in tabular data.\n\n2. Approaches involving graph neural networks (GNNs), contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL), and hybrid models with autoencoders have consistently failed (e.g., **root_1_1_0_0_1**, **root_1_1_0_1_0**, **root_1_1_0_1_1**) with error codes, likely due to data sparsity, lack of explicit node/edge definitions, or computational infeasibility on the Titanic dataset. Similarly, complex feature engineering like polynomial expansion or k-means target encoding has failed in practice, indicating that overfitting or poor implementation leads to instability.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_0_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.6077) by replacing the neural network with a **lightweight autoencoder (e.g., 2-layer encoder with 64 units, ReLU activation) trained on raw features (age, fare, class, sex, cabin, embarkation)**, using only the latent space output as input to a **simple XGBoost classifier**. This combines the robustness of autoencoders in feature ex..."
