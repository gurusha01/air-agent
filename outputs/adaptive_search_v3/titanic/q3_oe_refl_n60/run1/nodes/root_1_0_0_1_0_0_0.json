Apply deep feature learning by transforming categorical variables into dense embeddings using one-hot encoding with dimensionality reduction via PCA, and use continuous variables as input layers. Train the model with early stopping and cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Monitor performance using a hold-out validation set and introduce gradient clipping to stabilize training dynamics. This approach leverages non-linear, hierarchical feature interactions that can capture complex patterns in survival data not easily modeled by tree-based methods.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline and other models. This success suggests that autoencoding raw features like age, fare, and cabin enables effective latent representation learning, capturing complex, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss. The high score indicates that autoencoders are particularly effective in handling sparse or noisy categorical features and in extracting meaningful, compressed representations.\n\n2. Approaches involving advanced architectures like GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_0, root_1_1_0_0_1), contrastive learning (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_1), and transformer-based tabular models (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_2, root_1_1_2_1_1) have consistently failed with error codes (400), suggesting technical or implementation issues\u2014likely due to data format mismatches, lack of sufficient structure for graph/attention modeling, or overfitting on small tabular data. These models are not only computationally expensive but also poorly suited to the sparse, tabular nature of the Titanic dataset.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_0_1_0_0** (score: 0.8612), which uses **XGBoost with target encoding and categorical feature processing**. A concrete direction is to **apply target encoding with smoothing (e.g., Laplace smoothing) to 'Embarked' and 'Cabin'**, and then **add polynomial features up to degree 2 for continuous variabl..."
