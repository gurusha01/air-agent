  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1*, both scoring 0.9474), which demonstrate that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features like age, fare, and cabin can capture complex, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss. This outperforms gradient boosting ensembles (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM) with scores peaking at 0.8589 (*root_1_1_0*), suggesting that while tree-based models are robust, they may not fully exploit the underlying structure in high-dimensional or mixed-type features.  \n\n2. Approaches involving advanced architectures like GNNs (*root_1_1_0_0_0*, *root_1_1_0_0_1*, *root_1_1_0_0_2*), contrastive learning (*root_1_1_0_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_1_1*), and transformer-based tabular models (*root_1_1_0_1_2*, *root_1_1_2_1_0*) have consistently failed\u2014likely due to data sparsity, lack of meaningful graph or sequence structure in passenger data, and model instability (error 400). Similarly, hybrid models with autoencoders and gradient boosting (*root_1_1_2_0_1*) and complex feature engineering (e.g., polynomial expansion) have failed, indicating overcomplication without clear gains.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_1_2_1_1* (score: 0.8349) by replacing the deep autoencoder with a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** that introduces structured noise to raw features (e.g., Gaussian noise to age or fare) and trains to reconstruct clean values. This will test whether rob..."
