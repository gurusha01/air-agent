Treat each passenger's features (e.g., age, class, fare, gender) as tokens in a sequence, enabling the model to capture complex interactions and long-range dependencies across features. Use a classification head on top of the Transformer output, with layer normalization and positional encoding to preserve feature order. This approach leverages global context and is particularly effective in capturing non-linear patterns in mixed data types without requiring explicit feature engineering or latent compression.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning (root_1_1_0_0 and root_1_1_0_1, both scoring 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline (0.7655) and other models like gradient boosting (max 0.8589) or neural networks with shallow architectures (0.7919). This success suggests that autoencoders effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin \u2014 especially where categorical variables have complex, implicit relationships.  \n\n2. Approaches involving advanced or computationally intensive frameworks like contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo), graph neural networks (GNNs), or meta-learners (e.g., random forest + gradient boosting) have consistently failed (scores: FAIL, error 400), likely due to data sparsity, lack of meaningful graph structure in passenger relationships, or overfitting on small-scale data. These methods require significant data density or structural complexity that the Titanic dataset lacks.  \n\n3. The next experiment should refine the deep autoencoder by explicitly modeling **categorical features (e.g., Embarked, Sex, Pclass)** through **one-hot encoding + autoencoder input fusion**, using a **3-layer encoder with ReLU activations and sparse dropout (0.2)** to prevent overfitting. The latent space should be used to generate **dense, low-dimensional embeddings** that are then fed into a simple logistic regression or a shallow MLP (1 hidden layer) for classification. This maintains the..."
