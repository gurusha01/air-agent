Additionally, incorporate a time-aware feature (e.g., inferred boarding time from ticket class and embarkation point) to model temporal dynamics in survival. This strategy captures non-linear interactions and contextual dependencies without relying on latent space or autoencoders.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which outperforms all others by effectively capturing non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin\u2014especially where traditional encoding fails. This success highlights that autoencoders can learn meaningful, compressed representations of complex, high-dimensional tabular data, outperforming both standard tree-based models and simpler neural networks.  \n\n2. Approaches involving advanced architectures like GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_0_2), contrastive learning (root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_1), and Transformers on tabular data (root_1_1_0_1_2) have consistently failed with error codes 400, suggesting instability in data preprocessing, model setup, or computational constraints\u2014likely due to poor feature alignment or lack of structured graph/signal definitions. These methods are not only technically complex but also prone to overfitting or data leakage in sparse, tabular datasets.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_0_2_0** (score: 0.8158) by introducing a **lightweight, structured deep autoencoder with only 2 hidden layers (128 \u2192 64 neurons, ReLU)**, trained on raw features (age, fare, cabin, sex, pclass), using **mean-squared error loss** and **batch normalization** to stabilize training. The encoder\u2019s latent space should be used to generate **low-dimensional embeddings**, which are then fed into a **simple ..."
