  "strategy": "Introduce a hybrid model combining gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) with a small-scale autoencoder for feature transformation. Instead of using the autoencoder for unsupervised pre-training, apply it only to transform continuous variables like age and fare into dense, non-linear embeddings, which are then concatenated with original categorical features (e.g., sex, class, embarkation). Use these transformed features as input to a gradient boosting ensemble. This approach leverages the interpretability and robustness of tree-based models while incorporating non-linear feature learning through the autoencoder to capture complex interactions, without sacrificing model transparency.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which demonstrates that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features\u2014especially for non-linear patterns in age, fare, and cabin\u2014can significantly boost accuracy. This outperforms both gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost) baselines (e.g., root_1_1_0: 0.8589) and simpler models, suggesting that deep feature learning captures complex, hidden interactions better than tree-based models in this dataset.\n\n2. Approaches involving advanced architectures like GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1), Transformers (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_2), contrastive learning (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_0), and complex feature engineering (e.g., polynomial expansion in root_1_1_0_2_0_0) have consistently failed with error codes (400), likely due to data sparsity, lack of structured graph/signal relationships, or overfitting in tabular data. These methods are not only computationally heavy but also fail to generalize on the small, noisy Titanic dataset.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_2_0** (score: 0.6435) by introducing a **lightweight, structured deep autoencoder with only two hidden layers (128 and 64 units)**, using ReLU activations, and applying **target encoding on categorical features (e.g., Embarked, Sex) before feeding them into the encoder**. This maintains the autoencoder\u2019s ability to learn latent patterns while incorporating domain-relevant feature encoding\u2014similar to..."
