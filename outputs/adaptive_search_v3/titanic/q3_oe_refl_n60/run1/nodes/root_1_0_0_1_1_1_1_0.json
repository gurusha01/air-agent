  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) to model passenger relationships as a social network, where nodes represent passengers and edges represent familial or social connections (e.g., siblings, spouses, parents, children). The GNN learns survival patterns based on the influence of social ties\u2014such as whether a sibling or spouse survived\u2014by propagating survival signals through the graph. This approach shifts from temporal sequences to relational dynamics, capturing latent social survival cues not captured by event order or static features.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1* with 0.9474 accuracy) and gradient boosting with target encoding (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0_0* at 0.8612). These methods work well because autoencoders effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin, while target encoding handles categorical variables like *Embarked* by converting them into meaningful numerical predictors\u2014both of which align with the Titanic dataset\u2019s complex, non-linear survival dynamics.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex or computationally intensive models like GNNs (*root_1_0_0_1_1_1*, *root_1_1_0_0_1*), time-series transformers (*root_1_0_0_1_1_1_1*), and contrastive learning (*root_1_1_0_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_1_1*) have consistently failed (scores \u2264 0.63 or marked as FAIL), likely due to overfitting, poor data structure alignment (e.g., no temporal or relational sequences), or excessive complexity on a tabular dataset with limited signal. These should be avoided in favor of simpler, interpretable, and data-structured methods.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_1* (0.8278) by introducing a **hybrid model** that combines a **deep autoencoder** (with 2 hidden layers, 128 and 64 neurons, ReLU activation) to learn latent representations of *age, fare, class, and cabin*, followed by a **LightGBM classifier** trained on both the original and autoencoder-encoded features.
