Treat each passenger as a node and create edges based on familial connections (e.g., siblings, spouses, parents/children). Use the GNN to learn relational patterns in survival likelihood, capturing social dynamics that traditional feature engineering might miss. This approach leverages relational structure in the data rather than relying on latent representations from autoencoders or raw feature transformations.",

  "reflection": "The deep autoencoder-based feature learning approach in **root_1_1_0_0** achieved the best score of **0.9474**, significantly outperforming baseline (0.7655) and other models, indicating that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features\u2014especially from noisy or high-dimensional inputs like *Age*, *Fare*, and *Cabin*\u2014is highly effective for capturing non-linear, hidden patterns in the Titanic dataset. This success suggests that unsupervised feature learning can uncover meaningful, compact representations that outperform traditional engineered features or simple tree-based models. In contrast, approaches like **stacked autoencoders (root_1_0_0: 0.6483)** and **neural networks without autoencoders (root_1_1: 0.7919)** underperformed, likely due to poor initialization or lack of effective pre-training, highlighting that autoencoders must be carefully designed to learn meaningful latent spaces. Gradient boosting models (e.g., root_1_1_0: 0.8589) perform well but fall short of the autoencoder\u2019s peak, suggesting that while they capture interactions, they lack the ability to discover latent structures. The consistent failure of **random forests with gradient boosting meta-learners (root_1_0_1: FAIL)** and **complex feature interactions (root_0, root_2: FAIL)** implies that overcomplicating feature engineering or introducing unstable interactions leads to overfitting or poor generalization. The next experiment should **refine the deep autoencoder by introducing a variation..."
