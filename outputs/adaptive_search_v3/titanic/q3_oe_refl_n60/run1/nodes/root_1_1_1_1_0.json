  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning in **root_1_1_0_0** and **root_1_1_0_1**, achieving a high score of **0.9474**, which significantly outperforms the baseline (0.7655) and other models. This success suggests that autoencoding raw features\u2014especially high-dimensional or noisy ones like *cabin* or *fare*\u2014can effectively capture latent, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss. The performance gain likely stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to learn compact, meaningful representations that better encode survival-related dynamics.\n\n2. Approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNNs)** and **contrastive learning** (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) have consistently failed, with multiple attempts returning errors (400 Bad Request), indicating potential data or implementation issues\u2014likely due to the lack of structured relational data (e.g., passenger interactions) in the Titanic dataset. Similarly, complex ensembles like **random forest with bagging + gradient boosting meta-learners** (e.g., root_1_1_0_1_0) and **stacked autoencoders** (root_1_0_0) have underperformed or failed, suggesting that overcomplication or poor feature engineering leads to instability or poor generalization.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_1_1** (score: 0.8206) by applying a **deep autoencoder with a focus on structured feature encoding**, specifically using a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** to reconstruct features like *age*, *fare*, and *..."
