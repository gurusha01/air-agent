Apply target encoding with smoothing to categorical variables and use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters. This approach leverages strong gradient-based optimization and explicit feature interactions, which can better capture survival dependencies than tree-based models without interaction terms.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which demonstrates that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features\u2014especially for high-dimensional or noisy inputs like *age*, *fare*, and *cabin*\u2014can significantly improve model performance by capturing non-linear, complex patterns that traditional models miss. This outperforms both gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost) and simpler ensembles, suggesting that deep feature learning is more effective in this domain than tree-based methods for the Titanic dataset.\n\n2. Approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, **contrastive learning (SimCLR, BYOL)**, and **Transformer-based tabular models** have consistently failed (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_2), likely due to data sparsity, lack of meaningful graph structure in passenger relationships, and overfitting on small-scale tabular data. Similarly, complex meta-learners (e.g., random forest + gradient boosting) or synthetic feature engineering (e.g., polynomial expansion) have underperformed or failed, indicating that overcomplication without clear feature grounding leads to instability.\n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the deep autoencoder at root_1_1_0_2_0 (score: 0.8158)** by introducing a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** with a sparse reconstruction loss to improve robustness to missing or noisy features (e.g., *cabin*, *embarked*), and then use the learned la..."
