  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline and other models. This success suggests that autoencoding raw features\u2014especially high-dimensional or noisy ones like *cabin* or *fare*\u2014can effectively capture latent, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss. The high score is likely due to the autoencoder\u2019s ability to learn compact, meaningful representations that preserve critical survival signals.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex or computationally intensive models like **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, **contrastive learning (SimCLR, BYOL)**, and **Transformer-based tabular models** have consistently failed (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_2), with repeated LLM errors and likely overfitting or data sparsity issues. These methods require dense, structured relationships or large-scale data, which the Titanic dataset lacks. Similarly, **polynomial feature engineering** and **meta-learners** (e.g., bagging + gradient boosting) have underperformed or failed, indicating that over-engineering or adding complexity without clear feature signal leads to instability.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_0_2** (score: 0.6364) by introducing a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** with a focus on *cabin* and *embarked* features, using a sparse reconstruction loss to preserve survival-relevant patterns while filtering out noise.
