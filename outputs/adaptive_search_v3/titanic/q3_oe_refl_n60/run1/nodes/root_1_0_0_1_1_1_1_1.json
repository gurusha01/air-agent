  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) to model passenger relationships as a social network, where nodes represent passengers and edges represent familial or social connections (e.g., siblings, spouses, couples). The GNN learns survival patterns by propagating features through these relationships, capturing latent social dynamics such as \"survival in family groups\" or \"shared risk behaviors\" that are not captured in individual features. This approach treats the dataset as a graph with temporal edges (e.g., boarding time) to enable dynamic relationship modeling, fundamentally shifting from sequence-based or tabular modeling to relational learning.",

  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1* with 0.9474 accuracy) and gradient boosting with target encoding (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_1_0* and *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_1* at 0.8278). These methods work well because autoencoders effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin, while target encoding handles categorical variables (e.g., *Embarked*, *Pclass*) by converting them into meaningful numerical representations that improve model generalization.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like GNNs (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_1_0*, *root_1_1_0_0_1*) or time-series models (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_1_1*) have consistently failed with error codes (400), suggesting instability in data preprocessing, graph construction, or model initialization\u2014likely due to lack of clear temporal or relational structure in the Titanic dataset. Similarly, hybrid models with autoencoders and gradient boosting (*root_1_1_2_0_1*) or deep attention mechanisms (*root_1_0_0_1_1_0_0*) have failed, indicating overcomplication without clear benefit.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_1* by introducing a **lightweight tabular transformer (e.g., TabTransformer)** applied only to the top 5 most predictive features (selected via permutation importance) to model cross-feature interactions without overfitting. This builds on the 0.8278 baseline of target-encoded gradient boosting wh..."
