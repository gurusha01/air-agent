  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning at **root_1_1_0_0** (score: 0.9474), which significantly outperforms baseline and other models. This success suggests that autoencoding raw features like age, fare, and cabin can effectively capture latent, non-linear patterns that traditional models miss\u2014especially in high-dimensional or noisy tabular data. The performance of **root_1_1_0** (0.8589) with gradient boosting on raw features also indicates that tree-based models are robust, but they don\u2019t match the expressive power of deep latent representations.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex or computationally intensive architectures\u2014such as GNNs (e.g., root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_0_2), contrastive learning (root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_1), or Transformers on tabular data (root_1_1_0_1_2)\u2014have consistently failed with error 400 (LLM failure), likely due to poor data structure compatibility or overcomplication. These methods require structured graph or sequence data, which the Titanic dataset lacks, and are not well-suited for sparse, tabular inputs. Similarly, experiments with polynomial expansion or synthetic features (e.g., root_1_1_1_0, root_1_1_0_2_0_0) show diminishing returns and instability.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_2_0** (score: 0.6435) by replacing the deep autoencoder with a **denoising autoencoder (DAE)** trained on the raw features (age, fare, cabin, sex, class), using a simple 2-layer encoder-decoder with..."
