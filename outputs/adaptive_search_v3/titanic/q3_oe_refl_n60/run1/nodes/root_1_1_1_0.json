  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approach so far is the deep autoencoder-based feature learning (root_1_1_0_0 and root_1_1_0_1, both scoring 0.9474), which demonstrates that auto-extracting latent representations from raw features like *age*, *fare*, and *cabin* significantly improves accuracy. This success likely stems from the autoencoder\u2019s ability to learn compact, non-linear feature embeddings that capture complex patterns in noisy or high-dimensional data, especially where traditional encoding fails (e.g., *cabin*).  \n\n2. Approaches involving complex architectures like GNNs (root_1_1_0_0_1, root_1_1_0_1_1) or contrastive learning (root_1_1_0_1_0, root_1_1_0_1_1) have consistently failed\u2014likely due to data sparsity, lack of meaningful passenger relationships, or overfitting on small-scale social graphs. Similarly, hybrid models like random forests with gradient boosting meta-learners (root_1_0_1) or stacked autoencoders (root_1_0_0) underperform or fail, indicating that these methods lack sufficient signal or are too computationally unstable on this dataset.  \n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_1_1** (score: 0.8421) by introducing a **deep autoencoder with a shared encoder for continuous and categorical features**, using *target encoding* on categorical variables (e.g., *Embarked*, *Pclass*) as input to the encoder. Specifically, encode *Embarked* and *Pclass* via target encoding before feeding them into the autoencoder\u2019s latent space, then use the learned latent featur..."
