  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) framework where passengers are represented as nodes in a social interaction graph, with edges formed based on shared cabin, ticket class, or family membership. The GNN learns relational patterns (e.g., family survival dynamics) directly from the graph structure, capturing implicit social dependencies that traditional models miss. This approach treats passenger relationships as first-order features, enabling the model to learn survival dependencies beyond individual attributes.",

  "reflection": "1. The deep autoencoder-based feature learning approach in **root_1_1_0_0** achieved the best score of **0.9474**, significantly outperforming baseline (0.7655) and other models like gradient boosting (0.8589) or neural networks (0.7919). This suggests that auto-extracting latent, non-linear representations from raw features\u2014especially from noisy or high-dimensional inputs like *Age*, *Fare*, and *Cabin*\u2014is highly effective for capturing complex, hidden patterns in survival outcomes.  \n\n2. Approaches involving **graph neural networks (GNN)** and **hybrid ensembles** like random forest with gradient boosting meta-learners (e.g., *root_1_0_1*, *root_1_1_0_0_0*) have consistently failed, likely due to data sparsity, lack of explicit passenger relationship graphs, or overfitting on small, noisy interactions. Similarly, **stacked autoencoders** (*root_1_1_0*) and **deep neural networks without pre-training** (*root_1_1*) underperformed, indicating that unsupervised pre-training or deep architectures alone are insufficient without strong feature engineering or regularization.  \n\n3. The next experiment should **refine the deep autoencoder framework** by introducing **denoising autoencoders (DAE)** to improve robustness against missing or noisy features like *Cabin* and *Embarked*, and apply **feature reconstruction loss with a sparse regularization term** to preserve meaningful latent patterns. Specifically, use a 3-layer encoder (128 \u2192 64 \u2192 32) and 3-layer decoder with ReLU activat..."
