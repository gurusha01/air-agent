  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are deep autoencoder-based feature learning (e.g., *root_1_1_0_0* and *root_1_1_0_1* with 0.9474 accuracy), which effectively capture non-linear, latent patterns in raw features like age, fare, and cabin. These outperform gradient boosting alone (baseline 0.7655) because autoencoders learn compact, meaningful representations that better model complex dependencies in tabular data. Similarly, XGBoost/LightGBM with target encoding and feature engineering (e.g., *root_1_0_0_1_0*) achieves strong scores (0.8612), showing that tree-based models with proper preprocessing are robust and interpretable.\n\n2. Approaches involving complex or unproven architectures like GNNs (*root_1_0_0_1_1_1*, *root_1_1_0_0_1*), contrastive learning (*root_1_1_0_1_0*), or time-series models (*root_1_0_0_1_1_1_0*) have consistently failed (scores \u2264 0.5933), likely due to data sparsity, lack of temporal structure, or overfitting on small, non-temporal datasets. Hybrid models with autoencoders and gradient boosting (*root_1_1_2_0_1*) also failed, suggesting that adding complexity without clear feature utility leads to instability. These should be avoided in favor of simpler, data-driven methods.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand *root_1_0_0_1_1_1_0* (score: 0.5933) by replacing the LSTM with a **TabTransformer** applied to *feature-wise embeddings* of categorical variables (e.g., Embarked, Sex, Pclass) and continuous features (e.g., Age, Fare), using a **self-att..."
