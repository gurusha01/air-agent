The approach that has worked best so far is implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and performing grid search for hyperparameter tuning, achieving a score of 1.0000. This method has demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency in predicting Titanic survival. Additionally, using a Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning using randomized search also performed well, scoring 0.8684. These models have shown their capability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively and tune their parameters to achieve optimal results.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed include applying ensemble learning techniques like combining Random Forests with Gradient Boosting Machines, which resulted in a failure. Another attempt was to use gradient boosting with LightGBM or XGBoost, but it encountered an error during execution. Implementing a Random Forest Classifier with tuned hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization also failed. These failures suggest that certain combinations of algorithms and techniques may not be suitable for this dataset or require more sophisticated handling.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring the use of a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with advanced hyperparameter tuning methods such as Bayesian Optimization. Given that GBMs have shown promise in previous experiments, utilizing Bayesian Optimization could help in finding the most effective hyperparameter settings. Additionally, considering the failu..."
