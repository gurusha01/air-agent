  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a neural network (e.g., a multilayer perceptron) using a fully connected architecture with 3 hidden layers (128, 64, 32 neurons), ReLU activation, and batch normalization. Apply dropout layers (0.3 and 0.5) to reduce overfitting. Preprocess categorical features using one-hot encoding with a threshold of 10% frequency to avoid overfitting, and apply target encoding with lambda = 0.05 for low-frequency categories. Use a Box-Cox transformation only on 'Age' and 'Fare' with automatic bounds, while leaving 'Pclass' and 'Sex' as raw inputs. Introduce interaction terms between 'Pclass' and 'Age' as new features, and use cross-validation with early stopping to prevent overfitting.",
