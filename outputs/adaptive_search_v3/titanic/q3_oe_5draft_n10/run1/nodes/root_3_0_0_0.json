  "strategy": "Replace the random forest ensemble with a gradient-boosting model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) and apply deep feature synthesis (DFS) to automatically generate higher-order interactions and polynomial features from the original variables. Use target encoding with smoothing for categorical variables like 'Embarked' and 'Cabin' to prevent overfitting. Additionally, introduce a temporal feature (e.g., 'age_at_sinking' derived from survival time) using a synthetic dataset that assumes a fixed sinking timeline. This approach leverages gradient boosting's superior handling of structured data and interaction patterns, while DFS enhances feature expressiveness beyond manual engineering.",
