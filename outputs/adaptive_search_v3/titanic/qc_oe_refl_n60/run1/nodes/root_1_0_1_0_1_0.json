The approaches that have worked best so far include switching to a Random Forest model with optimized parameters (score: 0.9043), implementing a Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (score: 0.8684), and incorporating additional features related to passenger class and age categorization (score: 0.8445). These methods have shown higher accuracy compared to other models and techniques.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed or should be avoided include implementing a Random Forest classifier after performing PCA (score: FAIL), integrating Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) into the current ensemble (score: FAIL), and switching from a traditional machine learning model to a deep learning neural network (specifically a CNN) designed to process image data (score: FAIL). These failures suggest that dimensionality reduction without proper feature engineering, overcomplicating the model, and not leveraging existing strong performers may not yield positive results.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring the use of a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model with a different set of hyperparameters, particularly focusing on adjusting the learning rate and number of estimators. Additionally, experimenting with stacking multiple models, such as combining the strengths of Random Forest and GBM, could also be beneficial. It's important to ensure that any new approach maintains or improves upon the baseline score of 0.7655 while avoiding overf..."
