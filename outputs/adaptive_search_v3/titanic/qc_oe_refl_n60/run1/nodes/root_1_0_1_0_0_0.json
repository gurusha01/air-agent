  "reflection": "1. The approaches that have worked best so far include switching to a Random Forest model with optimized parameters, achieving a score of 0.9043. Additionally, incorporating advanced machine learning models like XGBoost or LightGBM has shown promise, although some experiments resulted in failures.\n\n2. Techniques that have consistently failed include implementing PCA before a Random Forest classifier, attempting to use LightGBM, and experimenting with various combinations of hyperparameters without significant improvements.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring the incorporation of feature engineering techniques, such as creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., family size, deck level). Additionally, fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model further could potentially lead to higher accuracy. It's also worth considering stacking multiple models to combine their strengths and potentially improve overall performance."
