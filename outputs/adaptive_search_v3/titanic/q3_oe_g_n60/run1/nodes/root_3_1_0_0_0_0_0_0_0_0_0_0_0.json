  "strategy": "Introduce a gradient boosting model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) with class-weighted loss functions and a focus on boosting on age-band and class interactions, using a novel feature: the logarithmic ratio of fare to age (log(fare/age)) to capture economic vulnerability. Apply recursive feature elimination to select only the top 10 features and incorporate cross-validation with stratified sampling by survival class. This strategy shifts from tree ensembles trained on partitioned subsets to a sequential, adaptive boosting process that emphasizes high-risk groups.",
