  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a neural network architecture using a deep learning approach. Utilize a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with dropout regularization to mitigate overfitting. Introduce a novel feature: the interaction between passenger class and age group (e.g., \"young upper-class\" or \"elderly third-class\"), which may reveal behavioral patterns in survival. Preprocess categorical variables with target encoding, but apply a smoothing technique (e.g., Laplace smoothing) to stabilize estimates for rare classes. Use a cross-validation strategy with stratified folds and class-weighted loss to handle imbalance. Train on a subset of the data with a carefully selected hyperparameter grid via Bayesian optimization to avoid overfitting.",
