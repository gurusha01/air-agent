Create binary features indicating whether a passenger shares a family unit with a survivor or non-survivor, and use target encoding of cabin categories with survival outcomes. Apply a permutation-based feature importance analysis to identify the most impactful relational and demographic signals. Train the model with early stopping and cross-validation on stratified folds to reduce overfitting.",
