  "strategy": "Replace the tree ensemble with a deep neural network (DNN) using a fully connected architecture with batch normalization and dropout layers. Instead of group-level aggregates, create continuous, smooth embeddings for class, age, and deck using Gaussian processes to model survival probability distributions. Train the DNN on these embeddings with a custom loss function that penalizes deviations from known survival patterns (e.g., higher survival in first class, lower in third). This approach leverages non-linear interactions across high-dimensional continuous features without relying on discrete groupings or tree splits.",
