  "strategy": "Introduce a deep neural network (DNN) with fully connected layers and batch normalization, using continuous and categorical features (class, age, fare, gender, cabin deck) as inputs, with one-hot encoded categorical variables and age binning to create smooth, non-linear feature mappings. Use dropout layers for regularization and incorporate a survival probability head with sigmoid activation. Instead of tree-based interactions, rely on the DNN's ability to learn complex, high-order feature interactions through deep layers, while using mean imputation for missing values and scaling features via standardization. This approach enables modeling of non-linear survival patterns that may be missed by tree-based models, especially in subgroups with rare combinations of features.",
