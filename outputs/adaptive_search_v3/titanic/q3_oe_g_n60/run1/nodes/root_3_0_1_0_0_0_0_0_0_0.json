  "strategy": "Replace the deep learning model with a random forest ensemble using gradient boosting via the LightGBM framework, incorporating feature interactions through second-order polynomial features derived from the original categorical and continuous variables. Apply target encoding with recursive partitioning to handle high-cardinality categories, and introduce time-based splits (e.g., simulating different eras of the Titanic voyage) to model temporal dynamics in survival rates. Use a cost-sensitive learning approach that explicitly weights survival predictions to reflect higher penalties for false negatives, and incorporate stratified cross-validation to ensure robustness across survival subgroups.",
