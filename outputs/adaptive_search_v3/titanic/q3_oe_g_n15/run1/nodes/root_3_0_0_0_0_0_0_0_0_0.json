  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based survival prediction model that processes passenger features as sequential tokens, with attention mechanisms capturing complex, non-linear dependencies across categorical features (e.g., ticket class, port of embarkation, family size) and continuous variables (e.g., age, fare). Instead of relying on fixed feature engineering, the model learns cross-feature interactions directly from the input data. Use a masked language modeling objective during training to simulate missing data patterns observed in the Titanic dataset, thereby improving robustness to incomplete information. The final survival prediction is derived from the attention weights over survival-relevant feature groups.",
