Use node embeddings to capture latent social dynamics and incorporate survival as a node-level classification task. Preprocess the graph by binning age and fare into discrete intervals and use graph pooling to aggregate information across family groups. Evaluate using graph-based stratified cross-validation with class weighting to handle survival imbalance.",
