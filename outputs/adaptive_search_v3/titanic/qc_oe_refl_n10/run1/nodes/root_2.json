  "reflection": "1. The approach that has worked best so far is implementing a Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, achieving a score of 0.3636. This method effectively handles complex interactions between features, which is crucial for improving prediction accuracy in the Titanic survival dataset.\n\n2. The approach that has consistently failed or should be avoided is implementing a Random Forest classifier instead of a Logistic Regression model. While Random Forests are powerful, they may not always outperform simpler models like Logistic Regression, especially when the dataset is relatively small or the feature interactions are not extremely complex.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend trying a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with hyperparameter tuning. GBMs are known for their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and can often achieve higher accuracy than Random Forests. Additionally, experimenting with different feature engineering techniques, such as creating new features based on existing ones or applying transformations, could further improve performance."
