  "strategy": "Apply a Bayesian updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the column player's type (cooperative vs. selfish) based on observed actions. The row player selects Action A with probability proportional to the posterior belief that the column player is cooperative, and Action B otherwise. This approach incorporates prior beliefs and updates them using Bayes' rule after each interaction, enabling adaptive coordination without explicit reward modeling. The model uses a simple conjugate prior (Beta distribution) and updates beliefs based on observed choices, treating each round as evidence.",
