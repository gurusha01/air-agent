  "strategy": "The row player adopts a time-dependent adaptive strategy where the probability of choosing \"Coordination\" increases logarithmically with the number of consecutive rounds in which the column player chose \"Coordination.\" Specifically, after each round, the row player updates their choice probability using a learning rate of 0.1, adjusting the probability of \"Coordination\" to 0.7 + 0.05 * log(t + 1), where t is the round number. This allows the row player to gradually increase coordination efforts when the column player consistently prefers it, exploiting patterns in behavior over time.",
