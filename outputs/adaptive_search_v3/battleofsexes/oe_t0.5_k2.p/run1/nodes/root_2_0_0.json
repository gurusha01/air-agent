  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic reinforcement learning strategy where the row player updates its action probability using a Q-learning framework, with rewards derived from payoff differences based on the column player's actions. The agent observes the sequence of choices and adjusts its policy by learning the expected payoff of each action pair over time. The probability of choosing Action A is updated after each round using a learning rate of 0.1, and a discount factor of 0.9, allowing the model to prioritize long-term coordination while adapting to shifts in opponent behavior.",
