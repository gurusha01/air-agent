For instance, if the column player chose \"Sports\" in the last round, the row player increases the probability of choosing \"Movie\" to 0.8, anticipating a shift in coordination. Otherwise, it defaults to 0.6. This introduces dynamic adaptation to opponent behavior, leveraging temporal pattern recognition.",
