  "strategy": "Adopt a time-varying mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing each action based on the lagged column player's previous move. Specifically, if the column player chose action A in the previous round, the row player increases the probability of choosing action A by 0.15 (up to a maximum of 0.75), and decreases the probability of choosing action B to 0.25. This introduces dynamic responsiveness to observed behavior, capitalizing on potential patterns in the column player's choice sequence. The base probability starts at 0.6 for matching, and evolves with a decay factor of 0.95 over time.",
