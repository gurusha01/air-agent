  "strategy": "Use a mixed strategy where the row player chooses \"Movie\" with probability 0.7 and \"Sports\" with probability 0.3. This leverages the fact that in the Battle of Sexes game, when both players have symmetric preferences, a randomized strategy can achieve a higher expected payoff than pure coordination. The 0.7 probability on \"Movie\" reflects a slight bias toward the row player's preferred option, ensuring the column player is uncertain and thus more likely to match the row player's choice, leading to a stable equilibrium.",
