  "strategy": "Adopt a reinforcement learning-inspired strategy where the row player updates its action probabilities based on the cumulative payoff from past interactions. Specifically, after each round, the row player increases the probability of the action that led to a higher payoff (either A or B) by 0.10, with a cap of 0.75 and a minimum of 0.25. The update is only applied if the payoff difference exceeds a threshold of 0.10. This creates a feedback-driven adaptation that rewards successful outcomes while avoiding overfitting to noise.",
