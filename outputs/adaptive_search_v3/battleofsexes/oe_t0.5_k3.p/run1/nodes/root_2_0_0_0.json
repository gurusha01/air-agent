  "strategy": "Apply a Bayesian updating strategy with a conjugate prior over action payoffs, where the row player maintains a belief distribution over the column player's preference (favoring A or B) and updates this belief using observed payoffs. After each round, the posterior probability of the column player preferring a given action is updated using a Beta-Binomial model, and the row player selects the action that maximizes expected utility under the current belief. The strategy incorporates a prior that assumes equal preference initially, and updates the belief with a learning rate of 0.3 per observation.",
