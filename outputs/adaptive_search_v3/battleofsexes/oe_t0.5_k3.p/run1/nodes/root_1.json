This leverages the inherent asymmetry in the Battle of Sexes game, where both players have preferences for coordination but face a conflict of interest. By randomizing in a way that balances the risk of miscoordination, the row player increases the expected payoff through strategic unpredictability, especially when the column player is uncertain about the choice.",
