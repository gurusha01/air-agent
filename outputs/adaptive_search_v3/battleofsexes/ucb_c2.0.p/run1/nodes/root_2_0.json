  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic payoff-weighted strategy where the row player adjusts their choice based on the average historical payoff of each option (movie or stadium) relative to the column player's past selections. If the average payoff of choosing the movie when the column player picked movie is higher than the average payoff of choosing stadium when the column player picked stadium, the row player increases the movie probability by 0.1; otherwise, they increase the stadium probability by 0.1. This strategy uses payoff feedback to adapt, rather than relying on behavioral patterns. The initial probability is set to 0.5, and it evolves over time based on cumulative rewards.",
