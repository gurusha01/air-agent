  "strategy": "Adopt a randomized commitment strategy where the row player selects \"Home\" with probability 0.6 and \"Movies\" with probability 0.4, independent of the column player's signal. This leverages the inherent uncertainty in the column player's choice to create a mixed strategy that exploits the game's symmetry and avoids predictable patterns. The row player's average payoff is maximized by balancing expected gains across both outcomes, ensuring the opponent cannot exploit a consistent pattern.",
