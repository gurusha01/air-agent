  "strategy": "The row player adopts a dynamic Bayesian updating strategy where the probability of choosing 'Coordination' is modeled as a function of the opponent's past actions, using a simple Bayesian belief update with a learning rate of 0.1. Initially, the belief that the opponent prefers 'Coordination' is set to 0.5. After each round, the belief is updated based on the observed action (if opponent chooses Coordination, belief increases; if Conflict, belief decreases). The current strategy's probability of selecting Coordination is then set to 0.5 + 0.5 * (belief - 0.5), ensuring it stays within [0,1]. This approach leverages real-time opponent behavior estimation without assuming fixed patterns.",
