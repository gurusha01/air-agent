If the column player consistently chooses \"Coordination\" after the row player selects \"Conflict\", increase the probability of choosing \"Conflict\" to 0.70. Otherwise, maintain a baseline of 0.65. This adaptive strategy leverages observed patterns to exploit the column player's preference for coordination while introducing strategic responsiveness.",
