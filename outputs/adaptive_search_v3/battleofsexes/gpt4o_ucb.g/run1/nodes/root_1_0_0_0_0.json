  "strategy": "Experiment with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach where multiple agents play the role of the row player, each with its own DQN. The agents will collaborate by sharing certain information about their learned Q-values, creating a diverse learning environment. By practicing against each other's strategies, the agents can discover and adapt to various tactics, making it more likely that the collective knowledge surpasses a single agent's ability to identify optimal responses to the column player's actions. This diverse training set-up might lead to more robust strategies, potentially improving the average payoff beyond the current score.",
