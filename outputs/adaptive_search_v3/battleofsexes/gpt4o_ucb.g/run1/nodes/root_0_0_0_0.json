  "strategy": "Consider implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance the adaptability and performance over the classic Q-learning strategy. DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-values, which allows it to handle larger state spaces that are common in real-world applications. Begin by constructing a neural network with input nodes corresponding to the state representation, hidden layers to capture complex patterns, and output nodes representing the possible actions. The weights of the network are adjusted using experience replay, where a mini-batch of past experiences is sampled from a memory buffer, decorrelating consecutive experiences and leading to better convergence. Additionally, employ a target network to stabilize learning by updating its weights less frequently. This method could improve the average payoff by enabling the agent to generalize from past experiences in more complex environments. Key hyperparameters such as learning rate and exploration-exploitation balance (epsilon-greedy strategy) should be fine-tuned to optimize performance.",
