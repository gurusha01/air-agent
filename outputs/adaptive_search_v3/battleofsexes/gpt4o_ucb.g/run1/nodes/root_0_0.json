  "strategy": "Consider implementing a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach to tackle the Battle of Sexes game. The player can treat each column action as an arm of the bandit, utilizing algorithms like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling for decision-making. This method focuses on balancing exploration and exploitation by estimating the potential reward of each action based on past successes. As the interactions progress, the player can dynamically adjust the play strategy and converge towards actions with higher payoffs, potentially leading to an improved average score over time.",
