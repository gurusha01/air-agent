  "strategy": "Augment the Deep Q-Network with a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, specifically using a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. This approach involves training multiple agents representing different strategies in a centralized manner but allowing them to execute their strategies independently during testing. The idea is to leverage the diverse strategies and interactions during training to improve the row player's adaptability and flexibility in maximizing payoffs. By incorporating multi-agent learning, the row player can learn to predict and counteract varying strategies from the column player, hence improving overall performance.",
