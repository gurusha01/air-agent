Implement a setup where the generator attempts to produce strategies for the row player that maximize payoff, while the discriminator models the column player's strategy tendencies. By adversarially training these two neural networks, the generator continuous learns optimal responses to sophisticated strategies generated by the discriminator, effectively improving the row player's adaptability and anticipation of column player's moves.",
