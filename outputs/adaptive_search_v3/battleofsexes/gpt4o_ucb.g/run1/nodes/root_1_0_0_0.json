  "strategy": "Incorporate a reinforcement learning-based approach using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for the row player. The row player will be treated as an agent learning to navigate the game environment. Use a neural network to approximate the Q-value function, which predicts future rewards for state-action pairs. The Q-network will be trained through experiences sampled from a replay buffer where the agent interacts with the game. This setup allows the row player to learn optimal strategies over time by leveraging past experiences and exploring new strategies, ultimately aiming to improve average payoffs by better understanding the dynamics of the column player's potential strategies.",
