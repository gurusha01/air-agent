  "strategy": "The row player adopts a time-varying mixed strategy based on a moving average of the column player's past choices. Specifically, if the column player has cooperated in the last two rounds, the row player increases the probability of cooperation to 0.8; otherwise, it defaults to 0.6. This strategy leverages temporal pattern recognition and anticipates behavioral consistency in human players, who often exhibit streaks in their decisions. The probability is dynamically adjusted using a 2-round sliding window and a simple threshold rule.",
