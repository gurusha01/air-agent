  "strategy": "Implement a fractal-based coordination strategy where the coordination probability is derived from a self-similar recursive function that mirrors the opponent's action pattern over time. The function is defined as a piecewise fractal expansion of the opponent's previous 3 rounds' actions, using a base frequency of 0.4 and a recursive scaling factor of 0.7. At each round, the system computes a local fractal dimension based on the opponent's action sequence and adjusts coordination probability accordingly. This approach leverages geometric self-similarity in opponent behavior rather than periodic or temporal sinusoidal patterns.",
