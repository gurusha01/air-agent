  "strategy": "Introduce a phase-based action cycling mechanism where the row player alternates between two actions (e.g., A and B) in a periodic pattern, but with dynamically adjusted phase shifts based on the column player's recent action history. Specifically, if the column player chooses action X in the last 3 rounds, the row player shifts its cycle phase by +1 or -1 with equal probability, introducing a form of adaptive synchronization. The phase shift is determined by a simple parity rule: if the column player's action sequence has an even number of repetitions of a particular action, the row player delays its next action; otherwise, it anticipates. This creates a low-complexity, non-stationary pattern that exploits predictable behavior without relying on correlation or payoff weights.",
