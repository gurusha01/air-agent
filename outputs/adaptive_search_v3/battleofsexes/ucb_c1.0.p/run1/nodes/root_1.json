  "strategy": "Adopt a mixed strategy where the row player chooses \"cooperate\" with probability 0.7 and \"defect\" with probability 0.3, based on the assumption that the column player is uncertain about their own payoff structure. This leverages behavioral psychology insights, where uncertainty induces a preference for stable, predictable outcomes. By introducing a slight bias toward cooperation, the row player maximizes expected payoff in symmetric games like Battle of Sexes, where both players prefer to meet but have conflicting preferences.",
