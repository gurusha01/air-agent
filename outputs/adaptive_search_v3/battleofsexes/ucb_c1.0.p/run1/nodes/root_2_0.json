This introduces cyclical adaptivity\u2014instead of a monotonic increase, the row player alternates between high and low coordination probabilities in a smooth wave pattern, leveraging the periodic nature of opponent behavior to exploit predictable patterns. The phase of the wave is shifted based on the average payoff from the last 3 rounds to align with opponent responsiveness.",
