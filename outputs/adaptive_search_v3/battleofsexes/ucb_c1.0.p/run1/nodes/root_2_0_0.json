  "strategy": "Implement a piecewise-constant mixed strategy with adaptive threshold switching based on the opponent's historical action pattern. Divide the game into time intervals (e.g., every 5 rounds), and within each interval, maintain a fixed coordination probability. The threshold for switching intervals is dynamically updated using a moving average of the opponent's action frequency\u2014specifically, if the opponent chooses the row player's preferred action more than 60% of the time in the last 4 rounds, shift to a higher coordination probability. Otherwise, maintain a lower probability. This strategy uses discrete phase transitions to exploit opponent inertia and avoid smooth oscillations.",
