  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player adjusts their action probabilities based on the cumulative reward received from past interactions. Specifically, after each round, the row player updates the probability of choosing \"Fight\" using a simple epsilon-greedy rule: if the past three rounds show a higher average payoff from \"Fight\" than \"Accord\", the probability of choosing \"Fight\" increases by 0.1 (capped at 0.9), otherwise it decreases by 0.1 (capped at 0.1). The initial probability is set to 0.5.",
