This creates a credible threat of delay, which may influence the column player's choice to align with the row player\u2019s preferred outcome (e.g., both choosing \"Go to Movie\" if row prefers that). The strategy exploits the column player\u2019s tendency to anticipate and respond to signals of intent.",
