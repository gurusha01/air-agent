Specifically, if the column player chose \"Accord\" in the previous round, the row player selects \"Fight\" with probability 0.7; otherwise, they choose \"Fight\" with probability 0.3. This introduces dynamic adaptation based on behavioral feedback, leveraging temporal correlation in player choices to anticipate future alignment.",
