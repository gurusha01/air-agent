If the column player chose \"Accord\" in the previous round, the row player increases the probability of choosing \"Accord\" to 0.7; otherwise, they choose \"Fight\" with probability 0.65. This introduces dynamic adaptation based on observable behavior, exploiting potential learning or pattern recognition by the column player.",
