  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player uses a simple Q-learning agent to estimate the long-term payoff of choosing \"Fight\" or \"Accord\" based on the column player's last three moves. The agent updates its policy after each round using a learning rate of 0.1 and decays the reward signal based on whether the column player consistently chooses \"Accord\" or \"Fight\" in the past. The row player then selects \"Fight\" with probability proportional to the estimated Q-value of that action, updated every round.",
