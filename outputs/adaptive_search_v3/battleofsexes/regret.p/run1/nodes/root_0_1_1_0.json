  "strategy": "Adopt a time-series momentum-based strategy where the row player tracks the sequence of past outcomes and adjusts their action based on the strength of recent trends. Specifically, if the last three rounds show a consistent pattern of \"Fight\" leading to higher payoffs than \"Accord\", the probability of choosing \"Fight\" is increased by 0.15 (capped at 0.8). Otherwise, if \"Accord\" has been more rewarding in the recent past, the probability is reduced by 0.15 (capped at 0.2). The initial probability is 0.5, and the strategy resets every 10 rounds to avoid overfitting to short-term noise. This approach leverages temporal dynamics and trend detection rather than simple rolling averages.",
