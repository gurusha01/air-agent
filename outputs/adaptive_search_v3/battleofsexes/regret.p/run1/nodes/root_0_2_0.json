Specifically, if the column player has chosen \"Accord\" in at least two of the last three rounds, the row player sets the \"Fight\" probability to 0.4; otherwise, it is set to 0.6. This leverages temporal persistence in the column player's behavior, assuming that streaks of cooperation are more likely to continue, prompting a counter-adaptive response.",
