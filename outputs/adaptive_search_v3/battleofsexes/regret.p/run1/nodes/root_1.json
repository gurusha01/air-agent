  "strategy": "Use a mixed strategy where the row player chooses \"Cooperate\" with probability 0.6 and \"Defect\" with probability 0.4, based on an observed pattern of the column player's historical choices. This strategy exploits the fact that in the Battle of Sexes game, when one player is more predictable, the other can anticipate and adjust accordingly. By introducing a slight bias toward cooperation (which is often preferred in coordination games), the row player increases the likelihood of achieving a higher payoff through mutual selection of preferred outcomes.",
