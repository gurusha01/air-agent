  "strategy": "Adaptively learn the column player's preference pattern over time by observing their past choices and adjusting the row player's strategy dynamically. Start with a baseline of 50% cooperation and 50% defection, then update the probability of choosing the column player's preferred option (movie or restaurant) based on the frequency of their choices in the last 5 rounds. If they consistently choose movie, increase the probability of selecting movie to 70%; if they favor restaurant, shift to 70% restaurant. This strategy uses reinforcement learning principles with a simple moving average to detect preference trends.",
