  "strategy": "Implement a feedback-weighted probabilistic strategy where the row player's choice probability is adjusted based on the lagged outcome (payoff) of the previous round, rather than just the column player's action. Specifically, if the previous round resulted in a coordination outcome (both players choosing Coordination), the row player increases its Coordination probability to 0.75; if the outcome was a mismatch (one player chose Coordination, the other didn't), the probability is set to 0.5; otherwise, it defaults to 0.6. This strategy uses payoff feedback as a signal of success, encouraging coordination when it leads to higher payoffs.",
