  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player models the column player's preferences as a probabilistic distribution over possible types (e.g., \"prefers movies\" or \"prefers restaurants\") using conjugate priors. After each round, the row player updates the posterior distribution based on the observed choice, and selects the action that maximizes the expected payoff under the current belief. The prior is initialized uniformly, and posterior updates use Bayes' rule with a learning rate of 0.1. This approach incorporates uncertainty explicitly and adapts to shifts in the column player's preferences through probabilistic inference.",
