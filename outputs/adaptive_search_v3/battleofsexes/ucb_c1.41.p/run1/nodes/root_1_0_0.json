  "strategy": "Use a Bayesian belief updating strategy where the row player starts with a uniform prior over the column player's preference (50% movie, 50% restaurant) and updates beliefs using a beta-binomial model after each round. After observing the column player's choice, the row player updates the posterior distribution of their preference and selects the option with the highest expected payoff based on the updated belief. The selection probability is set to the posterior probability of the column player preferring that option, with a small exploration noise (0.05) to avoid overfitting to short-term patterns.",
