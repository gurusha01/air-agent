After every round, update the Beta parameters (\u03b1_O, \u03b2_O) and (\u03b1_F, \u03b2_F) based on whether the opponent played Opera or Football.  \n2. Before each new round, draw one random \u03b8_O ~ Beta(\u03b1_O, \u03b2_O) and \u03b8_F ~ Beta(\u03b1_F, \u03b2_F).  \n3. If \u03b8_O > \u03b8_F choose the row action that gives the higher payoff when the opponent plays Opera; otherwise choose the action best against Football.  \n4. Add a small \u201cforgetting\u201d factor (e.g., multiply both \u03b1 and \u03b2 by 0.99 every 100 steps) to stay adaptive against non-stationary opponents.  \nThis requires no feature engineering, converges quickly, and directly maximizes expected payoff.",
