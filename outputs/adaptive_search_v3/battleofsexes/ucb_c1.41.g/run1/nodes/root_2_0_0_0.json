  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based policy gradient strategy where the row player learns an action policy through on-policy trial and error, using a neural network to approximate the value function of each action (cooperate or defect) given the opponent's past history. The policy is updated via episodic reward maximization, with a discount factor of 0.95 to balance immediate and future payoffs. The model uses raw observation sequences (action history) as inputs and learns to predict the optimal action by maximizing cumulative reward over a rolling window of 100 rounds. This approach treats the opponent's behavior as a stochastic environment and learns an adaptive policy without explicit belief modeling.",
