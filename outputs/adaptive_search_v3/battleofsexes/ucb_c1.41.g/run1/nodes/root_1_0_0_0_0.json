  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning strategy using a deep Q-network (DQN) with convolutional layers to process spatial patterns in the sequence of actions. Instead of using lagged features, the model encodes the last 5 rounds of both players' choices into a 2D temporal grid (e.g., 5\u00d72 matrix), where each cell represents a player\u2019s action. The convolutional layers learn spatial correlations between actions, such as synchronized coordination or alternating patterns. A reward signal is derived from the difference between coordination payoff and the average individual payoff. The DQN updates its policy using experience replay and a discount factor \u03b3 = 0.95 to prioritize long-term rewards. This approach leverages spatial feature extraction to detect emergent coordination patterns that TD-learning with eligibility traces might miss.",
