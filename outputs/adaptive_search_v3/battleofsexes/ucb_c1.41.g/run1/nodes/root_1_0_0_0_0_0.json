  "strategy": "Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units to model the temporal evolution of the game. Instead of encoding the last 5 rounds into a 2D grid, feed a sequence of action pairs (row player, column player) into a single LSTM that tracks the history of actions over time. The LSTM learns temporal dependencies such as patterns of cooperation or alternation, and the output is used to predict the next action. The reward function is based on the payoff difference between the actual outcome and the expected coordination payoff. This approach focuses on dynamic sequence modeling rather than spatial correlation, making it fundamentally different from convolutional feature extraction.",
