  "strategy": "Implement a Kalman filter-based dynamic belief updating system where the row player maintains a state estimate of the opponent's preference (cooperate or defect) using a hidden Markov model. The filter updates beliefs in real time based on observed actions, with process noise and measurement noise tuned to reflect uncertainty in opponent behavior. The row player then chooses the action that maximizes the expected payoff under the current belief state, switching between cooperation and defection based on whether the posterior probability of the opponent preferring cooperation exceeds 0.6. This strategy uses time-varying state transitions and incorporates a forgetting factor to give higher weight to recent observations while smoothing out noise.",
