The policy then selects cooperate with probability proportional to the current trust level, using a learned transition matrix derived from historical opponent behavior. Features include lagged opponent actions (last 5 rounds) and row player's own past actions, encoded as one-hot vectors. The model uses a simple linear classifier with L1 regularization to predict trust state transitions and action probabilities.",
