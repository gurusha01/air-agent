If the column player has chosen \"Coordination\" more than 60% of the time in the last 5 rounds, increase the row player's probability of choosing \"Coordination\" to 0.7; otherwise, maintain a baseline of 0.5. This leverages behavioral patterns and anticipates the column player's preferences through real-time feedback.",
