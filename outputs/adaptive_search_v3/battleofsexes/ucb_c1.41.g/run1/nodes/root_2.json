  "strategy": "Adopt a time-varying mixed strategy where the row player randomizes between coordinating with the column player and defecting based on a decaying memory of past outcomes. Specifically, after each round, if the column player chose the same action as the row player, increase the probability of repeating that action by 10% (up to a maximum of 70%). Otherwise, reduce the probability of repeating by 5%. This introduces adaptive learning with a bounded memory and leverages dynamic adjustment to exploit patterns in opponent behavior.",
