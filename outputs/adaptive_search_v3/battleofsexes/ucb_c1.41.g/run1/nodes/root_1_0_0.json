  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player uses a Q-learning model to update the payoff estimates for each action (\"Coordination\" or \"Individual Choice\") based on the observed outcomes of past rounds. The model learns the value of choosing \"Coordination\" when the column player has previously chosen \"Coordination\" or \"Individual Choice,\" and adjusts its policy accordingly. The probability of choosing \"Coordination\" is updated every 3 rounds using the learned Q-values, with a decay factor of 0.95 to prevent overfitting.",
