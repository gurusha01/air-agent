  "strategy": "Frequentist Change-Point UCB: track the opponent\u2019s last segment of play non-parametrically. Keep running counts of Left/Right since the most recent change-point; trigger a reset to a new segment whenever a G-test on the last 20 moves rejects the \u201cconstant bias\u201d null at 5 %. Within each segment, estimate the column bias p\u0302 and an Upper-Confidence radius c = \u221a(1.5 ln t / n). If p\u0302 + c < 0.5, assume the opponent favors Left and play the row that pairs with Left (my-preferred); if p\u0302 \u2013 c > 0.5, assume they favor Right and play the other row; otherwise randomize 50-50. Optimism (the c term) supplies automatic exploration without any fixed \u03f5-greedy phase, and the explicit change-point test lets the policy rapidly re-adapt after opponent preference flips.",
