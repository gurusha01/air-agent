Estimate the empirical probability p of the opponent choosing the row-player-preferred coordination cell (R,C1) versus the other (R,C2).  \n3. Compute the expected payoff of playing Up versus Down under this belief.  \n4. With probability (1-\u03b5) choose the action that maximises this estimated payoff; with probability \u03b5 play the other action to continue exploring (start \u03b5=0.10 and decay toward 0.02).  \n5. Reset counts with small probability to avoid being trapped if the opponent switches strategy.  \nThis lightweight frequency learner quickly locks on to coordination if the column player is biased, while remaining flexible enough to shift when they change, boosting average reward beyond the static baseline.",
