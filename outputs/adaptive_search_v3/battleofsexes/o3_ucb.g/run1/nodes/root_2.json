Start with an uninformative Beta(1,1) prior. After every round, update the Beta posterior with the observed column. At each step choose the row that maximizes expected row-player payoff under the current posterior (break ties toward own-preferred outcome). To encourage exploration early, play the posterior-mean\u2013optimal row with probability 0.9 and the other row with probability 0.1 for the first 10 rounds, then switch to pure exploitation. This adapts quickly against both stationary and slowly drifting opponents while avoiding initial coordination failure.",
