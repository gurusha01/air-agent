  "strategy": "Explore a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to optimize the row player's strategy. In this setup, encode potential strategies as chromosomes consisting of sequences of game actions. The initial population of strategies is randomly generated, and through iterations called generations, apply selection, crossover, and mutation operators to evolve strategies over time. This evolutionary process encourages the survival of the fittest, promoting strategies that yield higher payoffs. By periodically introducing variations (mutations) and combining successful strategies (crossover), the approach aims to discover robust strategies that might outperform those found through deep reinforcement learning alone.",
