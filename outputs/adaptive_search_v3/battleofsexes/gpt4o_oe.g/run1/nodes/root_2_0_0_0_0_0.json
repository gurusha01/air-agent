  "strategy": "Introduce a deep reinforcement learning approach using a neural network-based model. Employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to approximate the optimal strategy. The model will be trained using a form of reinforcement learning, such as Deep Q-Learning, where the agent learns to maximize its expected payoff by interacting with the environment and updating its strategy based on feedback. Reinforcement learning can capture complex strategies by leveraging a neural network to map states to actions and iteratively improve the decision-making policy through exploration and exploitation. This approach can adaptively learn to play against various strategies, potentially leading to an improved payoff.",
