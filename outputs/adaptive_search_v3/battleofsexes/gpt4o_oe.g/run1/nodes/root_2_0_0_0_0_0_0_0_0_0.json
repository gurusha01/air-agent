  "strategy": "Consider implementing a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) to leverage the advantages of deep learning for function approximation. DQN can address the limitations of traditional Q-learning by using neural networks to approximate the Q-value function. This allows the model to handle more complex state spaces that may arise in the Battle of the Sexes game. The strategy involves training a neural network to predict the expected payoff of taking certain actions in given states, updating its weights via backpropagation based on past experiences stored in a replay buffer. The combination of Q-learning and neural networks can potentially lead to better convergence and more accurate predictions, ultimately leading to improved payoffs for the row player.",
