  "strategy": "Implement a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach using Q-learning. This strategy involves formulating the game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the row player learns to maximize its payoff by iteratively updating the Q-values associated with different strategies based on the observed feedback. The player explores various strategies in the action space and updates its knowledge of the expected payoff of actions in different states using a learning rate and a discount factor. By balancing exploration of new strategies and exploitation of known high-payoff strategies, the row player can improve its average score over time.",
