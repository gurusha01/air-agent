  "strategy": "Consider implementing a Bayesian Optimization approach to maximize the row player's payoff. This technique uses probabilistic models to estimate the payoffs of different strategies and iteratively selects strategies that are likely to improve the score based on these estimates. Start by randomly sampling a set of strategies, similar to the initial population in a genetic algorithm. Then, use a Gaussian process to model the relationship between strategies and their payoffs, repeatedly selecting new strategies that maximize an acquisition function (such as Expected Improvement or Lower Confidence Bound) that balances exploration and exploitation. This approach can potentially discover highly effective strategies while requiring fewer evaluations than a genetic algorithm, saving computational resources.",
