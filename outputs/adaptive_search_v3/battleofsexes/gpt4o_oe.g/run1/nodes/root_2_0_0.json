  "strategy": "Implement a genetic algorithm (GA) approach, treating each player as a population of potential strategies represented by chromosomes. Each chromosome would be a series of parameters characterizing a player's strategy, including probabilities of selecting different actions. Use crossover and mutation to evolve the population over several generations. Evaluate the fitness of each chromosome by simulating games and calculating average payoffs. This approach allows exploration of unconventional strategies through genetic diversity. Adapt strategies via an elitist selection process, where top-performing chromosomes are preserved across generations, ensuring a high-quality gene pool to outperform the baseline score.",
