  "strategy": "Consider implementing a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach. In this setup, treat both the row and column players as agents using deep Q-networks (DQNs), allowing for more complex representation of strategies and states than standard Q-learning. Employ separate neural networks for predicting the Q-values of each agent's actions. Use a continuous action space representation to allow for smoother transitions between actions, potentially leading to a more refined strategy convergence. Implement experience replay and use target networks to stabilize training and prevent oscillations in the learning process. As learning progresses, adjust exploration rates using a softmax policy to ensure a balance between exploring new strategies and exploiting known high-reward actions.",
