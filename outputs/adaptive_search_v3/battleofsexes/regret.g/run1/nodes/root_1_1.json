  "strategy": "Adopt a time-varying mixed strategy where the probability of choosing Action A dynamically adjusts based on the lagged history of the column player's previous move. Specifically, if the column player chose Action A in the previous round, increase the probability of choosing Action B by 0.1; otherwise, maintain a base probability of 0.55. This introduces adaptive learning without assuming fixed preferences, exploiting potential behavioral patterns in the column player's choices.",
