  "strategy": "The row player adopts a time-dependent mixed strategy where the probability of choosing Action A is modulated by a sinusoidal function of the round number. Specifically, the probability of Action A is set to 0.5 + 0.3 * sin(\u03c0 * t / 10), where t is the current round. This introduces temporal variation in behavior, making it harder for the column player to predict actions based on historical patterns. The strategy exploits potential behavioral inertia in the column player, who may respond to predictable rhythms, thus increasing coordination potential through dynamic uncertainty.",
