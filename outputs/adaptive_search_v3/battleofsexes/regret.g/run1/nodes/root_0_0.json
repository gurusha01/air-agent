  "strategy": "Implement a time-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing Action A based on the time of day, using a sinusoidal function to modulate the choice. For instance, the probability of choosing Action A is modeled as 0.5 + 0.3 * sin(\u03c0 * t / 12), where t is the hour of the day (0 to 23). This introduces a cyclic pattern that makes the strategy appear non-repeating and unpredictable, potentially confusing the column player who may rely on temporal patterns.",
