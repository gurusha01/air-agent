  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player updates its action selection based on a reward signal derived from the column player's move. Specifically, after each round, if the row player chooses Action A and the column player also chooses A, the row player increases the probability of choosing A by 0.05; if the column player chooses B, the probability of choosing A decreases by 0.05. This creates a feedback loop that learns to anticipate the column player's behavior through temporal rewards, treating the game as a sequential decision-making problem with immediate feedback.",
