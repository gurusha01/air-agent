If they have consistently chosen the cinema, then play cinema with 70% probability; if they have consistently chosen the restaurant, play restaurant with 70% probability. This exploits behavioral patterns in the column player's preference expression, assuming they have a stable preference over time. The strategy shifts dynamically based on observed behavior, rather than a static match-based rule.",
