  "strategy": "Implement a strategy based on environmental noise modeling, where the row player's choice probability is derived from a random walk with drift, initialized at 0.5 and perturbed by a small, exponentially decaying noise term. The noise is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation that decreases over time (e.g., \u03c3(t) = 0.2 * e^(-t/100)), creating a slowly stabilizing but still unpredictable pattern. This strategy mimics human-like behavioral fluctuations without relying on time-of-day cycles or periodic functions.",
