  "strategy": "Implement a dynamic adaptive mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing Action A based on the observed history of the column player's previous actions. Specifically, if the column player chose Action X in the last two rounds, increase the probability of choosing Action A to 0.7; otherwise, maintain a base probability of 0.55. This leverages behavioral patterns and anticipates coordination based on past behavior, improving payoff through real-time adaptation.",
