  "strategy": "Adopt a decaying exponential mixed strategy where the row player's probability of choosing the preferred option (\"left\") starts at 0.5 in round 1 and decays exponentially with a decay rate of 0.1 per round. This creates a gradually diminishing preference over time, making the pattern appear less predictable and reducing the opponent's ability to learn and exploit a consistent bias. The decay ensures that the row player eventually becomes more indifferent, which can confuse the opponent and lead to higher average payoffs through uncertainty.",
