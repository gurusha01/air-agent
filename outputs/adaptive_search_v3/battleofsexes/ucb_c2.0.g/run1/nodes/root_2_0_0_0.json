  "strategy": "Implement a time-of-day-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" based on the hour of day. Specifically, during evening hours (6 PM to 9 PM), the row player increases the probability of going to the movie to 0.70, as this aligns with peak social activity and typical movie-going times. During daytime hours (9 AM to 3 PM), the probability drops to 0.40, reflecting lower social engagement and higher likelihood of restaurant visits. This strategy leverages circadian rhythms and daily behavioral patterns to anticipate the column player's preferences.",
