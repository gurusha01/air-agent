  "strategy": "Introduce a sentiment-based mixed strategy using real-time social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) to infer public mood around leisure activities. When positive sentiment scores for \"movies\" exceed 0.65 (indicating high social enthusiasm), the row player increases the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" to reflect collective behavioral trends. Conversely, when sentiment for \"dating\" or \"social events\" spikes above 0.70, the row player shifts toward \"Go to Restaurant\" to align with social dynamics. This strategy leverages natural language processing to detect mood shifts in public discourse, treating sentiment as a proxy for social availability.",
