  "strategy": "Introduce a weather-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts their choice probability based on real-time weather conditions. When the weather is sunny or warm (temperature above 20\u00b0C and cloud cover below 30%), the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" is increased to 0.65, as sunny days correlate with higher social outings and relaxed schedules. Conversely, during rainy or cold conditions (temperature below 10\u00b0C or precipitation above 50%), the probability drops to 0.35, reflecting reduced outdoor activity and stronger preference for indoor dining. This leverages environmental signals to anticipate behavioral shifts in the column player.",
