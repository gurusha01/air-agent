  "strategy": "Implement a weather-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" based on real-time weather forecasts. Specifically, when precipitation probability exceeds 30%, the row player shifts toward \"Go to Restaurant\" (lowering movie probability), as rainy days correlate with reduced outdoor activity. Conversely, on sunny days, the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" increases to 0.75. This leverages environmental cues that may indirectly influence the column player's preference for indoor versus outdoor activities.",
