  "strategy": "Introduce a time-of-day-dependent mixed strategy where the row player adjusts their choice based on local hourly traffic patterns. Using historical data from public transit and road sensors, the row player increases the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" when traffic congestion is below 25% (indicating off-peak hours), as people are more likely to have free time and socialize. When congestion exceeds 40%, the probability drops to 0.30, reflecting higher work commitments and reduced leisure time. This strategy uses temporal traffic signals as a proxy for behavioral availability rather than weather.",
