  "strategy": "Adopt a time-varying mixed strategy where the row player adjusts cooperation probability based on the column player's previous action. If the column player cooperated in the last round, the row player cooperates with 70% probability; if they defected, the row player defects with 60% probability. This leverages sequential feedback to anticipate coordination attempts and exploit patterns in the column player's behavior, increasing payoff through adaptive learning.",
