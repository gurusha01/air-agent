  "strategy": "Adaptive mirroring with memory decay: The row player observes the column player's past actions and maintains a weighted history of their actions over the last 5 rounds, where each past action is discounted exponentially (decay factor of 0.9). If the column player's average cooperation rate in the last 5 rounds exceeds 55%, the row player mirrors their action with 80% probability; otherwise, they choose cooperation with 60% probability. This strategy introduces dynamic alignment based on recent behavioral trends while reducing overreaction to short-term fluctuations.",
