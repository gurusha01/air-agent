  "strategy": "Implement a frequency-based payoff prediction strategy where the row player estimates the column player's long-term payoff from cooperation versus defection based on historical outcomes. The cooperation probability is then set to the proportion of rounds where the column player previously received a higher payoff when the row player cooperated. This strategy uses payoff feedback as a signal of preference rather than action history.",
