If the column player has cooperated more than 60% of the time in the last 3 rounds, the row player defects with 70% probability; otherwise, they cooperate with 70% probability. This introduces strategic responsiveness to behavioral patterns without full commitment, exploiting the column player's potential inconsistency.",
