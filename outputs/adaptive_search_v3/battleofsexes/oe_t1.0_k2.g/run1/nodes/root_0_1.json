Specifically, if the column player cooperated in the previous round, increase the cooperation probability to 70% in the next round; if they defected, reduce it to 30%. This introduces adaptive learning based on observed behavior, exploiting the column player\u2019s potential for pattern recognition or preference consistency over time.",
