The row player selects \"Home\" with probability proportional to the ratio of times the column player chose \"Home\" in the last 3 rounds, and \"Away\" otherwise. This approach uses temporal context modeling and avoids direct reinforcement updates by focusing on historical co-occurrence patterns, treating the game as a sequence of correlated decisions.",
