  "strategy": "Implement a reinforcement learning-based strategy where the row player adjusts the probability of choosing \"Movie\" based on the column player's choice history over the last 3 rounds, using a sliding window average of their past actions. Specifically, if the column player has chosen \"Movie\" more than twice in the last 3 rounds, the row player selects \"Movie\" with probability 0.7; otherwise, they select \"Football\" with probability 0.7. This strategy uses temporal pattern recognition and a simple moving average to anticipate future behavior, leveraging behavioral trends without relying on binary past choices.",
