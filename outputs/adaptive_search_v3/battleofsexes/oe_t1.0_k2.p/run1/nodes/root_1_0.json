  "strategy": "Implement a frequency-dependent adaptive strategy where the row player observes the column player's past actions and adjusts their own probability of cooperating based on the proportion of times the column player has previously cooperated. Specifically, if the column player cooperates more than 50% of the time, the row player increases their cooperation probability to exploit consistency. Otherwise, they decrease cooperation to induce defection. This strategy uses a simple moving average with a 3-round window to smooth observations and avoid overfitting to noise.",
