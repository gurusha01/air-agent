If the column player chose \"Go to Movie\" in the last two rounds, increase the probability of choosing \"Go to Movie\" to 70%. Otherwise, default to a 50% chance. This leverages behavioral momentum and anticipates coordination patterns, exploiting potential consistency in the column player\u2019s preferences.",
