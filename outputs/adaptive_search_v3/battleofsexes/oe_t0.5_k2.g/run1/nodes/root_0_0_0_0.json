  "strategy": "Implement a Bayesian updating strategy where the row player maintains a posterior distribution over the opponent's type (cooperative vs. conflict-prone), updating it based on observed actions. The player then selects actions that maximize expected payoff under this posterior, with a prior assuming equal likelihood of opponent types. The model uses a conjugate prior (Beta distribution) and updates the belief after each move, allowing for adaptive learning with minimal computational overhead. This approach avoids explicit sequence modeling and instead focuses on type inference, which can reveal hidden patterns in opponent behavior over time.",
