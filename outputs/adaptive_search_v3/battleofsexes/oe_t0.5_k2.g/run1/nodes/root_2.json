  "strategy": "Adopt a randomized mixed strategy where the row player chooses \"Go to Movie\" with a 60% probability and \"Go to Football\" with a 40% probability. This strategy is based on the Nash equilibrium of the Battle of Sexes game, where both players randomize to prevent the other from exploiting predictable behavior. By maintaining a consistent but unpredictable pattern, the row player maximizes expected payoff in the long run, as the column player cannot perfectly anticipate the choice.",
