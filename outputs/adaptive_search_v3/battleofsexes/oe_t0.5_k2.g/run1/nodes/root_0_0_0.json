  "strategy": "Adopt a state-based reinforcement learning strategy where the row player updates its action probabilities in real time based on a sliding window of the opponent's last 5 moves, using a Q-learning framework with a discount factor of 0.9. The strategy learns to exploit patterns such as alternating coordination or prolonged conflict by adjusting the probability of coordination when the opponent has recently chosen conflict, and vice versa. This approach leverages sequential feedback to dynamically refine the mixed strategy without relying on fixed cyclic patterns.",
