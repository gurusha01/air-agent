  "strategy": "Use a Gaussian Process regression model to predict the column player's future cooperation based on historical action patterns, treating each action as a noisy observation from a latent cooperative tendency. The model learns a smooth, probabilistic surface over time and updates its belief dynamically with new data. When the predicted probability of cooperation exceeds 0.6, the row player cooperates with probability 0.7; otherwise, they defect with probability 0.3. This approach emphasizes uncertainty quantification and avoids overfitting to short-term fluctuations.",
