  "strategy": "Use a Random Forest classifier to predict the column player's action based on lagged history (e.g., past 3 actions) and a binary encoding of cooperative vs. defective behavior. Features include action frequency, alternation patterns, and deviation from the mean. The model is trained on historical data with bootstrapped sampling to improve stability. When the predicted probability of cooperation exceeds 0.55, the row player cooperates with probability 0.7; otherwise, they defect with probability 0.3. This strategy introduces non-parametric, tree-based reasoning that captures complex interactions not modeled by Gaussian processes.",
