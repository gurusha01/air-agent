  "strategy": "The row player adopts a time-varying mixed strategy where the probability of choosing Action A dynamically adjusts based on the historical sequence of moves made by the column player. Specifically, if the column player has chosen Action X more frequently in the last three rounds, the row player increases the probability of choosing Action B to disrupt patterns. This introduces temporal dependency and exploits the column player's potential habit formation or memory bias.",
