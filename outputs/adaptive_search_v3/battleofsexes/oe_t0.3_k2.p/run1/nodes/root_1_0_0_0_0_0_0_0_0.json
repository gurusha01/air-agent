  "strategy": "Use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to model the column player's action sequence as a time-series, treating each action as a discrete output. Features include past 5 actions, action duration (in rounds), and a sliding window of cooperation-defection ratios. The LSTM learns temporal dependencies and predicts the next action with a softmax output. When the predicted probability of cooperation exceeds 0.60, the row player cooperates with probability 0.7; otherwise, defects with probability 0.3. This approach captures dynamic behavioral patterns through sequential learning, distinct from tree-based or static feature methods.",
