Instead of relying on LSTM state transitions, the model processes the action history as a fixed-length sequence with attention weights highlighting key historical events (e.g., sudden shifts to cooperation). The row player then sets their cooperation probability to 0.7 if the model\u2019s predicted cooperation probability exceeds 0.65, otherwise 0.3.",
