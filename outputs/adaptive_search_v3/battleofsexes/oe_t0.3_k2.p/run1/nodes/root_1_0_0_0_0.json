The RNN learns temporal dependencies in the action history and outputs a predicted probability of cooperation at the next step. The row player then sets their cooperation probability to 0.7 if the LSTM predicts a cooperation probability above 0.65, otherwise 0.3. This approach captures long-range dependencies and dynamic shifts in behavior that static KDE models miss.",
