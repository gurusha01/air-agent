  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a Random Forest ensemble, using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to improve stability. Apply target encoding with regularization on categorical features like sex, class, and embarkation port, and introduce polynomial features of age and fare (up to degree 2) to model interaction effects. Use stratified sampling to maintain class balance during training and validate on a hold-out set with out-of-bag (OOB) score estimation for early stopping. This approach leverages tree-based robustness to noise and non-linearity while maintaining interpretability.",
