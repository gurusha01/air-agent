  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosted tree ensemble with a neural network architecture using a deep feedforward network with batch normalization and dropout regularization. Instead of hashing categorical features, apply one-hot encoding with dimensionality reduction via PCA on the resulting feature space. Allow the neural network to learn complex non-linear interactions implicitly through dense layers, moving beyond tree-based recursive partitioning. Train with early stopping and use a learning rate scheduler to improve convergence and prevent overfitting. This shift from tree-based to neural modeling enables the capture of high-dimensional, non-linear patterns in the data that may not be fully accessible to tree ensembles.",
