  "strategy": "Introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model passenger relationships and social networks, where each passenger is a node and edges represent interactions such as shared cabins, families, or same embarkation point. The GNN learns how social proximity influences survival\u2014e.g., family members surviving together or groups being transported to lifeboats. Use graph convolution layers to aggregate neighborhood survival signals and incorporate temporal embedding of interaction timing. This approach shifts from individual behavior to relational dynamics, capturing group-level behavioral patterns that are often overlooked in traditional models.",
