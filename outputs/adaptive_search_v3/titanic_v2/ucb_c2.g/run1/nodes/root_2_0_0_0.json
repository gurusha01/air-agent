  "strategy": "Introduce a deep neural network (DNN) with a multi-layer perceptron architecture, where input features are transformed via a learned embedding layer for categorical variables (e.g., passenger class, gender, embarkation point), and the model is trained with dropout regularization and batch normalization to improve generalization. Use a data augmentation technique that generates synthetic age and fare values based on class and gender distributions to address potential data sparsity. Evaluate using early stopping on a validation set to prevent overfitting. This approach captures complex, non-linear patterns across high-dimensional feature spaces that traditional ensembles may miss.",
