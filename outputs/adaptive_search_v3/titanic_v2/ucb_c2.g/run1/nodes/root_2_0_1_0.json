Use cross-validation with stratified splits to tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, max depth, and subsample ratio. Incorporate interaction terms in the feature space by creating polynomial features for continuous variables like age and fare, and use a strong regularization penalty to prevent overfitting. This approach leverages gradient boosting\u2019s superior performance on structured tabular data and target encoding to capture group-level patterns in categorical features.",
