  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a gradient boosting model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using categorical features encoded via one-hot expansion, and apply target encoding to continuous variables like age and fare. Introduce interaction terms between 'sex' and 'class' and 'age_group' and 'fare_per_person' to capture nuanced survival patterns. Use early stopping and cross-validation to prevent overfitting, and incorporate feature importance pruning to focus on the most predictive interactions. This approach leverages gradient boosting's strong performance on structured tabular data with explicit handling of feature interactions and categorical variables.",
