  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosted tree model with a neural network architecture using dense layers and batch normalization. Introduce continuous latent embeddings for categorical variables (e.g., passenger class, gender) and use a multi-layer perceptron to learn non-linear interactions between features such as age, fare, and embarkation point. Apply dropout layers to prevent overfitting and train using early stopping on a validation set with a learning rate scheduler to optimize convergence. This approach can capture complex, high-dimensional patterns not easily modeled by tree-based methods.",
