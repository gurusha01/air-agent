Instead of engineered categorical features, use continuous embeddings for categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoded cabin letters mapped to dense vectors) and apply a self-supervised learning approach to generate latent representations of passenger profiles via contrastive learning on survival outcomes. Train using early stopping on a validation set with a focus on reducing variance through stochastic weight averaging.",
