Instead of embeddings, apply one-hot encoding with target encoding for categorical variables, and introduce feature interactions via polynomial features up to degree 2. Optimize hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization and incorporate cross-validation with stratified splits. This approach leverages tree-based modeling\u2019s strong performance on structured tabular data and robustness to feature interactions, which may capture non-linear patterns more efficiently than deep networks in this dataset.",
