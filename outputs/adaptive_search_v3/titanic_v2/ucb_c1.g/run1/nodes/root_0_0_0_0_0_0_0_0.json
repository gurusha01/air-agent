  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based time-series model that encodes passenger boarding sequences as a sequence of latent states, where each state represents a combination of demographic features, deck, and time-of-boarding. The model learns long-range dependencies in boarding order and uses attention mechanisms to identify clusters of passengers who boarded at similar times and survived or perished. Survival is predicted based on contextual patterns in the boarding timeline, such as whether a passenger boarded early and was in a high-risk zone. This approach shifts from spatial graph modeling to temporal sequence modeling with attention, capturing dynamic behavioral patterns.",
