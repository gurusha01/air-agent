Use the encoder to reduce dimensionality and capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data, then train a separate survival classifier (e.g., logistic regression) on the latent space. This approach leverages unsupervised learning to discover hidden structures and may uncover non-obvious survival patterns not captured by traditional feature engineering or tree-based models.",
