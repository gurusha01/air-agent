  "strategy": "Replace the deep neural network with a gradient boosting ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using tree-based models to capture non-linear interactions and handle both categorical and continuous features natively. Use target encoding for categorical variables (e.g., encoding 'embarked' by the mean survival rate per group) to preserve group-level information. Apply feature scaling only to continuous variables via min-max normalization, and introduce interaction terms explicitly in the model (e.g., 'pclass * age') through feature engineering before training. This approach leverages the interpretability and strong performance on tabular data with non-linear patterns while avoiding the complexity and overparameterization of deep networks.",
