Engineer features using embeddings for categorical variables like passenger class and deck, and introduce polynomial features of degree 2 for continuous variables (e.g., age and fare) to capture non-linear relationships. Apply target encoding with smoothing for rare categories and use data augmentation via synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) to balance the survival classes during training.",
