  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a gradient boosting ensemble (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost) using optimized hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization. Focus on feature interactions by introducing polynomial features up to degree 2 for numerical variables and apply target encoding for categorical variables with high cardinality. Use a time-based split with a 3-year rolling window and validate using cross-validation with temporal stratification. This approach leverages tree-based models' ability to capture non-linear interactions and handle mixed data types effectively while being robust to overfitting through regularization and tree pruning.",
