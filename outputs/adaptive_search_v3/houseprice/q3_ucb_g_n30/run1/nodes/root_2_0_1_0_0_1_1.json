  "strategy": "Introduce a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) with target-specific boosting, where the model is trained to prioritize minimizing the squared error for high-median-absolute-deviation (MAD) price bins. Use feature engineering to create interaction terms between continuous variables (e.g., 'sqft_living' \u00d7 'floors') and encode categorical variables using target encoding with a k-fold cross-validation scheme to reduce overfitting. Apply early stopping on temporal validation splits to prevent overfitting to recent data. This approach leverages tree-based non-linearity and robustness to outliers, while maintaining interpretability and faster training than deep networks.",
