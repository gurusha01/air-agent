  "strategy": "Introduce a deep autoregressive time series model (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer or DeepAR) that treats house prices as a sequence with temporal dependencies, incorporating lagged price features, rolling statistics (e.g., 3-month mean and std), and external time-based covariates (e.g., month, seasonality, holidays). Apply a dynamic feature selection via a rolling window that adapts to seasonal patterns and uses a sparse autoencoder to compress high-dimensional input into a low-dimensional latent space before feeding into the model. This approach leverages temporal structure directly, which is often missed in static tree-based models.",
