Instead of relying on deep neural networks, leverage tree-based models' ability to capture non-linear patterns and feature interactions with minimal overfitting. Apply target encoding on categorical variables with smoothing to stabilize variance, and use quantile-aware boosting to adjust loss weighting during training, emphasizing accurate predictions for homes in the top 10% price bracket to improve R2 on high-value outliers.",
