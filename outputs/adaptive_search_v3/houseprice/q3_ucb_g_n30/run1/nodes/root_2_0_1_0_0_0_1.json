  "strategy": "Replace the deep neural network with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using targeted feature interactions derived from pairwise correlations between numeric features. Instead of modeling non-linearities through neural layers, leverage tree-based splitting to capture non-linear patterns and interactions more efficiently. Apply a weighted objective function where high-value homes (e.g., above 90th percentile of target) are assigned higher loss weights to improve R2 on the tail. Incorporate spatial features (e.g., distance to city center, neighborhood zoning) as categorical inputs with one-hot encoding. Perform feature selection via permutation importance to retain only the most predictive variables.",
