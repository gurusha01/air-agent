  "strategy": "Replace the neural network with a stacked ensemble of XGBoost and Random Forest models, where each model is trained on a different subset of engineered features derived from spatial proximity (e.g., distance to schools, parks, highways) and temporal trends (e.g., month-on-market, price changes over the last year). Use a dynamic weighting scheme during training where the contribution of each model is adjusted based on its performance on a rolling validation set. Apply a robust scaling of features using quantile transformation instead of Box-Cox to better preserve distributional properties in skewed variables, and introduce lagged target variables (e.g., 3-month and 6-month past prices) as additional predictors.",
