Apply a dynamic feature weighting scheme based on feature importance from each individual tree, and introduce lagged housing price features (e.g., 3-month and 6-month price changes) to capture temporal dynamics. Use a cross-validated time-series split with 3-month windows to ensure temporal consistency, and apply quantile regression to the target to better model the skewed price distribution.",
