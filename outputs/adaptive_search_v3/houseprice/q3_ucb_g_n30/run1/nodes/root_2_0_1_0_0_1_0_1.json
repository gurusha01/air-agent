Use temporal validation with cross-validated feature importance thresholds to ensure stability. Apply targeted outlier treatment via a mixture-of-experts architecture that models normal and extreme price regimes separately, improving fit for skewed tails. This approach leverages neural networks' capacity to model complex interactions and contextual feature relevance, while explicitly handling distributional shifts in high-value price segments.",
