Apply feature scaling with robust scaling (median absolute deviation) and introduce batch normalization between residual blocks. Use a custom loss function that combines mean squared error with a Huber loss component to reduce sensitivity to outliers, while applying gradient clipping during training to stabilize training dynamics. Validate using a time-series cross-validation with a rolling window to ensure temporal consistency.",
