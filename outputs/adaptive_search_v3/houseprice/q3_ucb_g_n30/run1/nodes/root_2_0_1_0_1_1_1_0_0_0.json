  "strategy": "Introduce a lightweight ensemble of gradient boosting machines (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) trained on handcrafted features derived from neighborhood-level statistics (e.g., median income, crime rates, school ratings, and property density). Instead of relying on graph structures, use spatial clustering to group nearby houses into bins, then aggregate features per bin (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation of price, age, square footage) to create richer, interpretable input features. Perform feature selection using mutual information to retain only the most predictive neighborhood-level attributes. This approach leverages well-established regression models with strong performance on tabular data with spatial correlations, while avoiding the complexity and potential overfitting of GNNs.",
