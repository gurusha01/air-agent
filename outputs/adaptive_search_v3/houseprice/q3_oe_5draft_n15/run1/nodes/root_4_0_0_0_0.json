Use feature engineering to create polynomial interactions (degree 2) between top 10 numerical features, selected via mutual information. Apply robust scaling to numerical inputs and use target encoding with smoothing for categorical variables. Optimize hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization with early stopping on R\u00b2. This approach leverages non-linear modeling capacity and interaction learning to capture complex patterns missed by tree-based models.",
