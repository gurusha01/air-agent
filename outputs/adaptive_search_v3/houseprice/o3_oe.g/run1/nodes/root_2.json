Minimal preprocessing: impute only numerical NA with median, keep text categories untouched, log-transform the three most right-skewed numeric features (GrLivArea, 1stFlrSF, TotalBsmtSF). \n2. Hyper-parameter sweep with Bayesian optimization over depth (4-10), learning_rate (0.02-0.2), l2_leaf_reg (1-9), bagging_temperature (0-1), early_stopping_rounds=200 using 5-fold CV on the training set. \n3. Use CatBoost\u2019s built-in cross-validation to obtain the optimal number of iterations and fit the final model on all data. \n4. Ensemble only by averaging the predictions of the top-3 hyper-opt runs weighted by their CV R\u00b2; submit these averaged predictions. \nCatBoost\u2019s ability to capture high-order categorical interactions without manual encoding typically yields a ~0.89-0.91 leaderboard R\u00b2 in this competition while requiring less feature engineering than gradient-boosting baselines.",
