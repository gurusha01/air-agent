The shallower depth curbs over-fitting on noisy categorical levels, the larger leaf count and longer training let the model better capture medium-order interactions, and the lower learning rate smooths the fit.  Together these tweaks often lift R\u00b2 by 0.005\u20130.010 on this dataset without changing overall methodology.",
