Hyper-parameters  \n   \u2022 num_leaves: 2\u00d7 current (e.g. 64 \u2192 128)  \n   \u2022 max_depth: \u20111 (unlimited)  \n   \u2022 min_data_in_leaf: 5 (was 20)  \n   \u2022 learning_rate: 0.02 (was 0.05)  \n   \u2022 n_estimators: 5000 with early_stopping_rounds=200  \n   \u2022 feature_fraction: 0.8  \n   \u2022 bagging_fraction: 0.8, bagging_freq: 1  \n   \u2022 lambda_l1: 1.0, lambda_l2: 1.0 (adds mild regularisation)\n\n2. Target & feature preprocessing  \n   \u2022 Keep SalePrice = log1p(SalePrice).  \n   \u2022 Standard baseline imputations, one-hot encoding.  \n   \u2022 On-the-fly, add \u03b5 ~ N(0, 0.001\u00b7\u03c3_feature) to each numeric feature per boosting iteration (implemented via LightGBM\u2019s \u201cfeature_fraction_seed\u201d hack or manual noise augmentation).\n\n3. Training protocol  \n   \u2022 5-fold K-fold CV; save OOF predictions; average CV models for submission.  \n   \u2022 Use categorical_feature=\u2018auto\u2019 so LightGBM handles one-hots natively.\n\nWhy it may help  \nDeeper trees + lower learning rate let the model capture higher-order interactions the baseline missed, while noise injection and L1/L2 keep overfitting in check. This often bumps R\u00b2 by 0.005-0.01 on this data set.\n\nImplementation effort: \u224830 lines difference from baseline notebook.",
