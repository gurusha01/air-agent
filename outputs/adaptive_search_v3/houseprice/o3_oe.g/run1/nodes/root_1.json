Include strong data preprocessing: impute missing values with KNN for numerics and the most frequent value for categoricals, Box-Cox/log transform skewed variables, clip extreme outliers, and create interaction terms like \u201cOverallQual \u00d7 GrLivArea\u201d. This heterogeneous ensemble often adds 0.01\u20130.02 to R\u00b2 on the leaderboard compared to single models.",
