Extended skew handling  \n   \u2022 For every numeric column with |skew| > 0.5, apply Yeo-Johnson (instead of log1p) to keep negatives in play.  \n   \u2022 Re-standardise afterwards (StdScaler) so tree splits are more consistent across folds.\n\n2. Narrow grid search around a smaller learning rate + more trees  \n   \u2022 learning_rate: 0.02\u20130.05 (currently 0.1)  \n   \u2022 n_estimators: 2500\u20134000 with early_stopping_rounds = 150 (watch cv-R2).  \n   \u2022 max_depth: 3\u20134, subsample: 0.6\u20130.8, colsample_bytree: 0.6\u20130.9.  \n   \u2022 min_child_weight fixed at 0.5 to encourage slightly deeper splits.\n\nThese two small adjustments usually add ~0.003\u20130.007 to public R\u00b2 because they a) normalise more features without losing sign information and b) let the model learn finer patterns with less shrinkage.",
