  "strategy": "Variation: Seed-bagged XGBoost with slightly lower learning rate and heavier column/row subsampling  \n\n1. Keep the same XGBoost model/code path as baseline but train N=10 independent models with different random_state seeds.  \n2. For each model set:\n   \u2022 learning_rate = 0.025 (baseline 0.05)  \n   \u2022 n_estimators = 4000 with early_stopping_rounds = 200 on 5-fold CV  \n   \u2022 max_depth = 4 (baseline 3)  \n   \u2022 subsample = 0.8 (baseline 1.0)  \n   \u2022 colsample_bytree = 0.4 (baseline 0.7)  \n   \u2022 reg_alpha = 0.1, reg_lambda = 0.9 (a bit more regularisation)  \n3. Average the 10 prediction vectors (simple mean).  \n\nRationale: Lower LR + more trees lets model fit subtler patterns, while stronger column/row subsampling and bagging different seeds reduce variance. Ensemble averaging typically adds ~0.005-0.01 R\u00b2 on this data without leaving the XGBoost methodology.",
