Still use the same K-fold CV but inside each fold create a 10 % in-fold early-stopping set so every fold learns its own best iteration; average the fold-specific best_iteration_ when refitting on full data.  \n2. Keep the rest of the preprocessing identical to baseline so we\u2019re isolating the impact of tree-capacity/regularisation trade-off.\n\nWhy it may help  \nLarger num_leaves allows LightGBM to model subtle non-linearities (e.g., OverallQual \u00d7 Neighborhood) that the small 31-leaf default can\u2019t fit. Restricting max_depth and raising L1/L2 should control variance. Lower learning rate + more boosting rounds often stabilise LightGBM and squeeze a few extra basis functions out of the data.\n\nImplementation effort: ~10 min change in the parameter dict.\n\nExpected lift: modest but noticeable if the balance is right.",
