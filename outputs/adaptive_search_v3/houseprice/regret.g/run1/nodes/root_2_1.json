  "strategy": "Apply a deep neural network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers and dropout regularization to model non-linear relationships in the data. Use feature scaling (standardization) and encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding with dimensionality reduction via PCA. Introduce interaction terms between numerical features (e.g., area \u00d7 age) to capture complex dependencies. Train the DNN using early stopping on a validation set and optimize hyperparameters with random search. This approach leverages neural network capacity to capture intricate patterns missed by tree-based models.",
