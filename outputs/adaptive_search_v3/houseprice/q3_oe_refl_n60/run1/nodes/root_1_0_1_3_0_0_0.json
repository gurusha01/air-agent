  "reflection": "1. The best-performing approaches so far are gradient boosting models (XGBoost/LightGBM) with Bayesian optimization, particularly when incorporating feature interactions, tree-depth regularization, and early stopping\u2014achieving a top score of **0.9129** (root_2). These models excel in capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions, which are critical in house price prediction where complex, non-additive patterns exist in features like neighborhood, condition, and square footage.\n\n2. Deep neural networks (DNNs), especially those with 3\u20135 hidden layers, ReLU activations, batch normalization, or embedding layers, have consistently failed\u2014ranging from **-4.1640 to -4.7147**, often due to overfitting, poor generalization on structured tabular data, or misalignment with the data's inherent tree-like patterns. Attempts to use VAEs or residual connections also failed, indicating that complex deep architectures are not well-suited for this dataset.\n\n3. The next experiment should expand **root_1_0_1_3_0_0** (score: 0.9018), which uses a **stacked ensemble** with random forest and gradient boosting base models and a **linear regression meta-learner**. To improve performance, we should add **target encoding with recursive partitioning** (as in root_1_0_1) to better capture group-level effects in categorical features like `neighborhood` or `condition`, and apply **time-aware cross-validation** to ensure robustness against temporal leakage. This maintains the strength of ensemb..."
