  "reflection": "1. **What approaches or techniques have worked best so far and why?**\n   - The Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV achieved the highest score of 0.8855. This suggests that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forests, combined with robust hyperparameter optimization, are effective for house price prediction.\n\n2. **What has consistently failed or should be avoided?**\n   - Adding interaction terms between existing features (root_0) and adding polynomial features using interaction terms (root_1) both resulted in failures. Similarly, switching to a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model like XGBoost or LightGBM (root_2_0), implementing a Gradient Boosting Regressor with Bayesian Optimization (root_2_1), and implementing an XGBoost regressor instead of a Random Forest Regressor (root_2_2) also did not yield positive results. These approaches either led to poor performance or outright failures, indicating that these strategies may not be suitable for this particular dataset.\n\n3. **What specific, concrete direction should the next experiment try?**\n   - Given the failure of previous attempts involving different ensemble methods and feature engineering techniques, the next experiment should focus on refining the Random Forest model further. Specifically, it could involve experimenting with different combinations of hyperparameters within the Random Forest framework, such as adjusting the `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples..."
