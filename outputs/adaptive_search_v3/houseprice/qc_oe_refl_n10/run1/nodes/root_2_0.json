  "reflection": "1. The approach that has worked best so far is implementing a Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. This method achieved an r2 score of 0.8855, which indicates that it effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting. The use of hyperparameter tuning helps in optimizing the model's performance by finding the best combination of parameters.\n\n2. Adding interaction terms between existing features (root_0) and adding polynomial features using interaction terms (root_1) have consistently failed to improve the model's performance. Both attempts resulted in a failure, suggesting that these methods may not be suitable for enhancing the current model's predictive power.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring feature engineering techniques such as scaling or normalizing the features. Additionally, considering different ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) could also be beneficial. It might be worth experimenting with different hyperparameter settings for the Random Forest Regressor to see if further improvements can be made."
