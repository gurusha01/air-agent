  "strategy": "Introduce a neural network with residual connections and attention mechanisms to model non-linear interactions between categorical and continuous features. Replace traditional feature engineering with a deep autoencoder to learn latent representations of house attributes, then use these embeddings as inputs to a regression head. Apply temporal feature dynamics via recurrent layers (e.g., LSTM) to capture long-term trends in listing patterns and price evolution across regions. Train with a price-aware loss function that amplifies gradients for high-value homes (above 90th percentile) using weighted mean squared error. Evaluate using a time-based split with quartile stratification to ensure high-value segment performance.",
