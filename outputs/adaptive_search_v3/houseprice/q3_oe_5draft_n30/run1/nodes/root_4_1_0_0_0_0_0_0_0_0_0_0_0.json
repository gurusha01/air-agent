  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) approach where properties are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges defined by geographic proximity or shared neighborhood characteristics. The GNN learns spatial dependencies by aggregating price information from neighboring properties, capturing local market dynamics that are not captured in traditional spatial or temporal features. Use a GraphSAGE or GCN architecture to encode neighborhood-level price patterns and combine them with temporal features (e.g., monthly trends) as a hybrid input. This fundamentally shifts the model from time-series to spatial network-based reasoning, enabling the model to learn local market clusters and their evolving price behaviors.",
