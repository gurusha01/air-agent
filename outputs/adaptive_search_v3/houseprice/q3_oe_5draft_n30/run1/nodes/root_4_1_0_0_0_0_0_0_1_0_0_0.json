  "strategy": "Apply a neural network with deep architecture (e.g., 3 hidden layers of 128, 64, 32 neurons) and use target encoding with a higher smoothing parameter (\u03bb = 0.3) for categorical variables. Incorporate a learnable embedding layer for categorical features to capture complex interactions, and normalize continuous features using min-max scaling. Use early stopping with a validation set to prevent overfitting. This approach leverages the non-linear expressiveness of neural networks to model complex interactions in house price data, especially in categorical-continuous combinations, while stabilizing estimates through smooth target encoding.",
