Apply target encoding with adaptive smoothing (lambda = 0.05 for high-cardinality variables) and incorporate a polynomial feature transformation for key numerical variables (e.g., log(area), area^2) to capture non-linear relationships. Use a validation set with stratified splitting to monitor R\u00b2 and apply early stopping with a patience threshold of 10 epochs.

  "reflection": "The gradient boosting ensemble (XGBoost/LightGBM) with Bayesian optimization has proven most effective, achieving the best score of **0.8964**, demonstrating that careful tuning of learning rate, tree depth, and subsampling significantly improves model performance. In contrast, the deep neural network (DNN) approach underperformed with a score of **0.8933**, likely due to overfitting on the limited feature space and lack of sufficient data to train a robust DNN. The Random Forest variant at **0.8623** failed to outperform the baseline, suggesting that increasing tree count and feature bagging alone is insufficient without better feature engineering or data preprocessing. Approaches involving custom features or targeted hyperparameter tuning (e.g., root_1 and root_2) have failed, indicating that without proper baseline validation or data quality, such additions are ineffective. The next experiment should expand root_0_0_0 by introducing **target encoding for categorical features** (e.g., neighborhood, condition) with **smoothed binning** to reduce variance, and apply **feature scaling** (standardization) to the numerical inputs before feeding into the Random Forest, as this has shown promise in Kaggle house price datasets. This targeted feature engineering should be paired with a **reduced tree count of 500** to balance variance and bias, avoiding overfitting while maintaining ensemble stability."
