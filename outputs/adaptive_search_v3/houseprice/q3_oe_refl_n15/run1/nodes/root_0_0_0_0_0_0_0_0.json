Use a learning rate scheduler with cosine decay over 200 epochs, and apply target encoding with lambda = 0.3 for categorical variables. Additionally, generate interaction terms between top 5 continuous features using polynomial expansion of degree 2, selected via mutual information, and apply dropout (0.3) during training to prevent overfitting. This approach shifts from tree-based to neural modeling, leveraging dense feature interactions without relying on gradient boosting or ensembles.",

  "reflection": "The best-performing approach so far is **XGBoost or LightGBM with max_depth=8\u201310 and interaction learning**, achieving a strong **R\u00b2 of 0.9058**, demonstrating that deep tree structures with feature interactions effectively capture complex, non-linear relationships in housing data\u2014especially when combined with target encoding. This outperforms both random forests and neural networks, which plateaued at 0.8958 or lower, suggesting that tree-based models with interaction capability are more robust to the categorical and mixed-feature nature of the dataset. In contrast, **deep neural networks (DNNs)** with 3\u20135 layers and batch normalization consistently underperformed (e.g., 0.6232), likely due to poor feature representation and overfitting on sparse, high-cardinality features. The **random forest with 1000 trees and feature bagging** (0.8623) failed to improve significantly, indicating that increasing tree count alone does not compensate for lack of interaction or target encoding. The next experiment should **expand root_0_0_0_0_0_0_0 (0.8958)** by introducing **target encoding with smoothing (e.g., lambda=0.1) on categorical features like 'neighborhood' and 'condition'**, and **adding interaction terms via polynomial features (degree=2)** to the XGBoost model, while keeping max_depth=9 and learning rate=0.05 to maintain stability and avoid overfitting. This builds directly on the successful interaction learning strategy while addressing potential encoding instability in the cu..."
