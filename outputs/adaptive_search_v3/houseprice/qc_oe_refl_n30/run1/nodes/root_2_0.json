  "reflection": "1. The approach that has worked best so far is implementing a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) as the meta-model in a stacking ensemble, achieving an r2 score of 0.8996. This method outperformed other models tested, including Random Forests and a Random Forest Regressor with tuned hyperparameters. GBMs excel at capturing complex patterns and interactions within the data, making them particularly suitable for regression tasks like house price prediction.\n\n2. Approaches that have consistently failed include applying a Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and incorporating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with multiple hidden layers. Both methods encountered issues during execution, likely due to overfitting, high computational costs, or difficulty in finding optimal hyperparameters.\n\n3. For the next experiment, I recommend exploring a different type of ensemble method, such as a Bagging ensemble with a different base estimator or a more sophisticated feature engineering technique. Additionally, considering ensemble blending rather than stacking could also be beneficial. It's crucial to monitor the performance closely and adjust hyperparameters accordingly to avoid overfitting while aiming to improve the r2 score further."
