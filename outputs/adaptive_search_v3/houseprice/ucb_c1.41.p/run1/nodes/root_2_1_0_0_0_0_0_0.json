  "strategy": "Replace the Gradient Boosting Machine with a Neural Network (e.g., a Multi-Layer Perceptron) using a dense architecture with 2\u20133 hidden layers and ReLU activation. Apply a targeted normalization step only on features with high kurtosis (kurtosis > 3.0), as these exhibit extreme outliers that can destabilize neural network training. Introduce dropout layers (10% dropout) to prevent overfitting, and use early stopping based on validation R\u00b2 to prevent overtraining. This leverages the neural network's capacity to model complex, non-linear interactions across high-dimensional feature spaces without relying on explicit polynomial expansions.",
