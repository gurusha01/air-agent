This ensemble method captures complex, non-linear patterns through iterative boosting, and its ability to handle heterogeneous feature interactions can improve R\u00b2 beyond linear models. Additionally, use early stopping to prevent overfitting and tune hyperparameters via cross-validation to optimize generalization.",
