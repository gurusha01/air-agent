Instead of relying on polynomial features, use feature interactions implicitly through tree splits and incorporate regularization (e.g., L2, L1) to prevent overfitting. Perform hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization to optimize learning rate, max_depth, and subsample ratio. This leverages the strong performance of gradient boosting in regression tasks with structured data and avoids the complexity of polynomial feature engineering.",
