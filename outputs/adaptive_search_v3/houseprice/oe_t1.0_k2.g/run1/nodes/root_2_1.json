Instead of polynomial features, focus on using tree-based models that inherently capture non-linear patterns and interactions through recursive splits. Perform feature scaling using robust scaling (median absolute deviation) to handle skewed distributions in housing features, and introduce target encoding for categorical variables like neighborhood or property type. This approach leverages strong performance in tabular regression while avoiding the overparameterization risks of polynomial expansions.",
