  "strategy": "Apply a Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) with tree-based learning to model complex, non-linear patterns in the data. Instead of polynomial features, use targeted feature interactions by creating cross-products of categorical and numerical variables (e.g., area \u00d7 bedrooms), and apply target encoding for categorical features like neighborhood or condition. Use early stopping during training to prevent overfitting and perform stratified cross-validation to ensure robust performance. This approach leverages ensemble learning with strong gradient-based updates, which typically outperforms Random Forests in structured regression tasks with rich feature interactions.",
