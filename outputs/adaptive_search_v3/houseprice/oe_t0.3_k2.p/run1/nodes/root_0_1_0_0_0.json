Use a custom loss function that weights outliers based on residuals, and incorporate categorical features via embedding layers with learned interactions. Train with early stopping and time-based cross-validation to prevent overfitting. This approach leverages non-linear feature interactions and adaptive learning that can capture complex patterns beyond tree-based models.",
