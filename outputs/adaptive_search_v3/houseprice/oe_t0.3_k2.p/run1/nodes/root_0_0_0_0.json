Apply feature binning on continuous features to capture non-linear relationships, and introduce interaction terms explicitly via product features. Use a stratified validation split and tune hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization to maximize R2. This leverages tree-based model strengths in handling non-linear patterns and interactions while maintaining interpretability and robustness in structured tabular data.",
