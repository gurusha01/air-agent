  "strategy": "Switch to a deep neural network with a residual architecture (e.g., ResNet-style blocks) and introduce batch normalization after each layer. Use a custom loss function that penalizes large residuals in high-value price ranges (e.g., homes above $1M) to improve performance on extreme tail predictions. Apply feature scaling via robust scaling (median absolute deviation) and use dropout with a rate of 0.3 to prevent overfitting. Train with a learning rate scheduler that reduces the rate by 10% every 50 epochs and validate using early stopping on R\u00b2, targeting 0.902. This approach leverages deep architecture stability and tailored loss design to capture non-linear patterns in high-value segments, distinct from ensemble or polynomial methods.",
