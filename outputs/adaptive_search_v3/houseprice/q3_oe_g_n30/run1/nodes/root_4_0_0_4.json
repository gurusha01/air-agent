  "strategy": "Replace the random forest ensemble with a gradient-boosted tree model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using a more aggressive pruning strategy with early stopping on validation R\u00b2, and apply target encoding with alpha = 0.3 to reduce overfitting. Additionally, introduce recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a linear model to select top 30% of features based on predictive power, ensuring that only the most impactful features are retained before training. This reduces noise and enhances model interpretability while maintaining strong performance in regression tasks.",
