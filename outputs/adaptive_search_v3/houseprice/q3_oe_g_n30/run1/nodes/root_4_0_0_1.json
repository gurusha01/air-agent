  "strategy": "Replace the random forest ensemble with a gradient-boosted tree model using XGBoost or LightGBM, incorporating a learning rate of 0.05 and a maximum depth of 8 to enhance generalization. Apply target encoding with alpha = 0.1 to reduce overfitting, and introduce only one interaction term (e.g., between 'neighbourhood' and 'year_built') using polynomial features of degree 2, selected via a statistical significance threshold (p < 0.05). Use early stopping with a validation R\u00b2 threshold of 0.902 and perform cross-validation with 5 folds to ensure stability. This approach leverages the robustness of gradient boosting with tighter regularization and targeted feature interactions, avoiding the complexity of ensembles.",
