  "strategy": "Replace the deep learning model with a gradient boosting ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using tree-based splits with targeted feature importance pruning. Introduce recursive feature elimination based on cross-validated R2 performance, retaining only features that consistently improve model stability across folds. Apply a dynamic learning rate schedule that adapts to neighborhood-level variance, reducing overfitting in high-volatility regions. Incorporate a temporal smoothing layer during training that dampens rapid price changes in short-term trends, preserving long-term patterns.",
