  "strategy": "Introduce a temporal convolutional network (TCN) with dilated convolutions to model long-range temporal dependencies in the housing data. Instead of lagged features, use time-series embeddings derived from rolling window statistics (e.g., 6-month moving average and exponential weighted moving average) applied to both numeric and categorical variables via one-hot encoding. Apply adaptive normalization using batch normalization with learned scaling parameters per time window to stabilize training. Train the TCN using a time-aware split with walk-forward validation, where each fold advances the time window by one month, ensuring temporal coherence. This approach leverages structured temporal patterns through convolutional filters, which can capture complex time-dependent trends that traditional neural networks or gradient boosters may overlook.",
