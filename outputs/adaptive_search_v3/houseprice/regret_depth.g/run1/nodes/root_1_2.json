Replace the polynomial expansion and Ridge regression with an ensemble model that learns complex, non-linear patterns through iterative tree-based splitting. Use feature importance to identify the most predictive variables and apply targeted feature selection to reduce noise. This approach captures intricate interactions and non-linearities more effectively than polynomial expansions, especially in high-dimensional housing data.",
