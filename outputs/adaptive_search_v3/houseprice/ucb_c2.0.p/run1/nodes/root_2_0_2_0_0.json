Instead of relying on neural networks, leverage tree-based models' ability to capture non-linear interactions and handle feature interactions through splits, while incorporating feature interactions explicitly via polynomial features up to degree 2. Use early stopping on validation R\u00b2 and apply feature scaling only on the training set after log-transformation. This approach shifts from dense neural networks to ensemble trees with structured feature interaction modeling, enhancing interpretability and robustness to noise.",
