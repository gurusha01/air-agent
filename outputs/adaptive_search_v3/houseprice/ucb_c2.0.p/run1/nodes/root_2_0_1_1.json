Instead of target encoding, use learnable embeddings with a shared latent space to capture complex, non-linear interactions between categorical features. Introduce batch normalization and dropout layers to improve generalization. Train using stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rates (e.g., Adam) and validate with time-series cross-validation to ensure robustness to temporal patterns in housing data.",
