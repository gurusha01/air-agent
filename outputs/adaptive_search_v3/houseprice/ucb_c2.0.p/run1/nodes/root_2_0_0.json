  "strategy": "Apply a gradient boosting machine (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) with optimized hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation. Unlike Random Forests, gradient boosting builds trees sequentially to correct residuals, often achieving higher predictive accuracy on structured tabular data like housing prices. Include feature scaling (standardization) before training to improve convergence and stability, and perform feature selection using mutual information to retain only the most predictive features (e.g., area, bedrooms, age, and location-based categorical encodings). This approach leverages strong non-linear modeling with structured optimization and data-driven feature prioritization.",
