  "strategy": "Replace XGBoost with a deep neural network (DNN) architecture using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), incorporating normalized continuous features and one-hot encoded categorical variables. Use batch normalization and dropout layers to stabilize training and reduce overfitting. Introduce feature interactions via polynomial features of degree 2 for selected continuous variables (e.g., area, age), and apply a residual connection between layers to improve gradient flow. Train the DNN with Adam optimizer and a learning rate schedule, using a 5-fold cross-validation with early stopping based on R2 score. This approach leverages the capacity of neural networks to model high-dimensional, non-linear interactions that gradient boosting may miss.",
