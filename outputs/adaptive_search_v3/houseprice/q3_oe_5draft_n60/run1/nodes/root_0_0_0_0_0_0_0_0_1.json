  "strategy": "Replace the deep residual network with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., LightGBM or CatBoost) using histogram-based binning for categorical features with optimal splitting thresholds. Apply target encoding with recursive feature elimination to reduce overfitting, and introduce weighted sampling based on target distribution to balance class imbalance in the price spectrum. Use early stopping with cross-validated R2 as the metric to prevent overfitting. This approach leverages tree-based model interpretability and efficient handling of non-linear interactions without requiring complex neural architecture.",
