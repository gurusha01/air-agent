  "strategy": "Introduce a neural network-based regression model (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron with batch normalization and dropout) that uses a hybrid embedding approach: encode categorical variables via learned embeddings (using a shared embedding matrix for all categorical features) and combine them with numerical features through a learned interaction layer. The model is trained with gradient accumulation and weight decay to improve generalization, and feature importance is monitored via integrated gradients to guide hyperparameter tuning. This approach captures complex, non-linear interactions that tree-based models may miss, while leveraging neural networks' capacity for high-dimensional feature combinations without relying on tree splits or target encoding.",
