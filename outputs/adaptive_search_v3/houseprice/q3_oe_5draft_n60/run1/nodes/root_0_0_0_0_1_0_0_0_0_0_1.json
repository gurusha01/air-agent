  "strategy": "Introduce a deep neural network (DNN) with a mixture of categorical and numerical inputs, using learned embeddings for categorical features (e.g., neighborhood, property type) and a fully connected layer to model complex non-linear interactions. Apply batch normalization and dropout for regularization, and use a custom loss function that weights errors based on data distribution (e.g., higher weight on outliers in high-value homes). Train using gradient-based optimization with early stopping on validation R2. This approach leverages neural networks' capacity to learn high-dimensional, non-linear interactions without relying on tree splits or target encoding, enabling direct modeling of complex patterns in feature spaces.",
