  "strategy": "Replace the MoE architecture with a deep ensembling approach using 10 independent gradient boosting machines (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) trained on different subsamples of the data with stratified splits. Each model is trained with distinct feature subsets (e.g., one with only neighborhood and condition features, another with only size and year-related features), and the final prediction is the average of all model outputs. This leverages the robustness of ensemble methods and reduces overfitting from specialized expert networks. Additionally, apply robust scaling to continuous features and use one-hot encoding with target encoding for categorical variables, but only for features with high cardinality (e.g., \"street\", \"alley\") to avoid overfitting.",
