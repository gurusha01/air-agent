  "strategy": "Introduce a deep learning-based spatial attention model using a Transformer architecture with geographic embeddings. Treat latitude and longitude as positional inputs and apply self-attention layers to dynamically weigh the influence of nearby neighborhoods based on historical price patterns. Instead of precomputed distance features, the model learns spatial relationships directly from the data through relative positional encoding and cross-neighborhood interactions. The output head is optimized via gradient-based R2 maximization using a differentiable loss that penalizes underfitting to spatial variance. This approach captures complex, non-linear spatial dependencies that traditional GP models may struggle with due to their reliance on fixed covariance functions.",
