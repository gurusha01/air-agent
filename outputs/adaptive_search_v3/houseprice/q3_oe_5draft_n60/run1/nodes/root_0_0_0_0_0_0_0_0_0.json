  "strategy": "Introduce a LightGBM ensemble with hierarchical feature interactions, where categorical variables are encoded using target encoding with smoothing (e.g., lambda smoothing) and then combined with one-hot encoded features via a recursive feature grouping strategy. Apply a novel feature interaction layer that learns pairwise multiplicative effects between selected continuous and categorical features using a learned interaction matrix, which is trained alongside the base model. This approach leverages gradient-boosted decision trees' strong performance on tabular data with explicit modeling of feature interactions, while maintaining stability through smooth encoding and structured interaction learning.",
