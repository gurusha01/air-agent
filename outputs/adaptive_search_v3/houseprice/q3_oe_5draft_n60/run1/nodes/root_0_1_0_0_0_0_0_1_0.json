  "strategy": "Replace the deep residual network with a gradient boosting ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using tree-based splits with depth regularization and histogram-based binning. For categorical variables, apply target encoding with smoothing (e.g., Lambda-M smoothing) to reduce variance, and introduce temporal features by binning the sale month into seasonal buckets (e.g., winter, spring, summer, fall) with interaction terms. Optimize hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization, where the objective is a weighted combination of R\u00b2 and cross-validated MSE, with early stopping based on plateau detection in validation R\u00b2. This approach leverages the interpretability and strong performance on structured tabular data while avoiding the complexity of deep networks.",
