  "strategy": "Introduce a transformer-based architecture with self-attention mechanisms over both continuous and categorical features, where categorical embeddings are processed through multi-head attention to capture complex cross-feature dependencies. Use a positionally-aware encoding for the sequence of features (e.g., via spatial ordering in the dataset) to model structural patterns in house attributes. Train with a weighted combination of MSE and a 0.99 quantile loss to emphasize extreme price outliers, and apply gradient clipping to stabilize training. This approach leverages attention to model global interactions rather than local, learned residual paths.",
