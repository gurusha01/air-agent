  "strategy": "Introduce a graph neural network (GNN) where houses are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges defined by geographic proximity, shared neighborhoods, or property ownership links. The GNN learns spatial dependencies and contextual relationships between houses, capturing local market dynamics that traditional models miss. Use graph attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh neighborhood influences, and incorporate spatial features (latitude, longitude) as node attributes. Train with a weighted combination of MSE and quantile loss (0.95) to maintain robustness to outliers in price distributions.",
