  "strategy": "Replace the tree-based ensemble with a deep feedforward neural network using a carefully structured architecture (e.g., 3 hidden layers with 128, 64, 32 units, ReLU activations) and apply dropout (10% per layer) to prevent overfitting. Preprocess categorical variables using one-hot encoding with a maximum cardinality threshold (e.g., 100 categories) and use target encoding only for variables above that threshold, with lambda-laddering for regularization. Introduce data augmentation via synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) for imbalanced target distributions (if any), and use a learning rate scheduler (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau) during training. Evaluate feature importance via integrated gradients to assess interpretability and stability. This shifts from tree-based to neural network modeling, leveraging deep non-linear patterns in high-dimensional data while maintaining robustness through regularization and structured augmentation.",
