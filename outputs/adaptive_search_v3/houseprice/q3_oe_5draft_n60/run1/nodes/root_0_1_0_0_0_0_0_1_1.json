  "strategy": "Replace the deep residual network with a random forest ensemble of gradient-boosted trees (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM), where each tree is trained on a different subsample of the data with stratified sampling by target deciles. Introduce a novel feature: a time-series difference feature capturing the gap between the sale price and the median price in the same neighborhood over the last 12 months, derived from a rolling window of historical transactions. Use a hybrid loss function that combines R\u00b2 with a weighted absolute error penalty to improve robustness to outliers. Optimize hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process surrogate, focusing on R\u00b2 and training stability. This approach leverages tree-based models' strong nonlinearity and robustness to noise while introducing domain-aware temporal features.",
