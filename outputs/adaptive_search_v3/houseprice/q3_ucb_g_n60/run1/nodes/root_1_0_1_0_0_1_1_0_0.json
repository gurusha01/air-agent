  "strategy": "Replace the TCN-based model with a lightweight random forest regressor that operates on time-lagged features. Instead of sliding window aggregations, create lagged features for each neighborhood (e.g., price, square footage, and lot size from the past 1, 3, 6, 12 months) and apply a temporal feature interaction matrix using pairwise product terms (e.g., price_lag1 * square_footage_lag3). Use a time-aware splitting strategy with non-overlapping 3-year windows and apply target encoding via a simple weighted average of historical prices per neighborhood, adjusted by seasonality (e.g., using sine/cosine encodings for month-of-year). This approach leverages ensemble decision boundaries and avoids explicit temporal modeling while capturing dynamic neighborhood shifts through feature interactions.",
