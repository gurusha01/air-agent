  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal convolutional network (STCN) that models house prices as a function of both geographic proximity and time trends (e.g., seasonal fluctuations, recent policy changes). The STCN will process grid-based neighborhood maps with temporal embeddings (e.g., month-of-listing, year-of-sale) to capture dynamic price shifts, such as those caused by economic booms or housing supply shocks. This approach explicitly models spatiotemporal dependencies that static models or hierarchical Bayesian models may miss, improving prediction in neighborhoods with evolving market dynamics.",
