  "strategy": "Introduce a random forest ensemble model with gradient-based feature importance pruning, where each tree is trained on a bootstrapped subset of the data partitioned by neighborhood and time. Instead of relying on spatial graph structures, we use tree-based learning to capture non-linear interactions between features (e.g., size vs. age vs. neighborhood) and automatically detect important feature combinations. We also apply temporal feature engineering by creating lagged interactions (e.g., price change from 3 months ago \u00d7 median income) and apply target encoding on categorical variables like neighborhood type. This approach leverages ensemble robustness and non-parametric flexibility to improve generalization beyond spatial propagation.",
