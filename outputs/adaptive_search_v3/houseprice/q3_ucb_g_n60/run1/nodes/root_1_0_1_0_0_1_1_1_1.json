  "strategy": "Apply a dynamic time warping (DTW)-based feature engineering step to align price trajectories across neighborhoods by warping time series based on similarity in price evolution patterns. Extract pairwise DTW distances between neighborhood time series to create a set of dynamic similarity features, then use these as inputs to a shallow neural network with a temporal attention layer. This approach captures non-linear temporal alignments that are not captured by lagged features or fixed window aggregations, enabling better modeling of heterogeneous price dynamics across regions.",
