  "strategy": "Introduce a stacking ensemble where the base models consist of a random forest, a gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), and a simple linear model. Use the outputs of these models as inputs to a meta-learner (e.g., a lightweight neural network or ridge regression) to predict house prices. For preprocessing, apply target encoding with smoothing (e.g., recursive smoothing or beta smoothing) to categorical variables to reduce overfitting, and perform logarithmic transformation on continuous features (e.g., log(area), log(price)) to stabilize variance and improve model convergence. Use time-based splitting with a rolling validation window to preserve temporal dynamics. Tune the stacking meta-learner\u2019s hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization) via Bayesian optimization with a focus on reducing prediction variance.",
