  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (ConvNeuralNet) with 1D convolutions applied on time-series derived features (e.g., lagged sales prices, monthly trends) to capture local patterns and temporal dependencies in housing data. Preprocess features by creating rolling statistics (mean, std, max) over 3-month windows and apply spatial encoding for geographic proximity features (e.g., neighborhood interactions). Train with a sliding window temporal validation scheme and use attention mechanisms to weigh important temporal lags dynamically. This approach leverages CNNs' ability to model local patterns in sequential data, which is underexploited in current tree-based models.",
