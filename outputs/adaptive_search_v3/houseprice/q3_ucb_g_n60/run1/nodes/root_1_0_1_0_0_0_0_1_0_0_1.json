  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal convolutional network (STCNN) that models house price dynamics as a function of both geographic proximity and time trends. The STCNN will process gridded neighborhood data with temporal embeddings (e.g., monthly price changes, seasonal trends) and spatial adjacency information, using learned filters to capture local price shifts due to events like infrastructure development or housing booms. This approach explicitly models temporal dynamics and spatial autocorrelation, which are often missed in static models, and can adapt to neighborhood-specific trends with high temporal resolution. The model is trained with a weighted loss that emphasizes stability in low-transaction neighborhoods to avoid overfitting.",
