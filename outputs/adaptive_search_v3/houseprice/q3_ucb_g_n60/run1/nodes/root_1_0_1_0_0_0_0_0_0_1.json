  "strategy": "Introduce a stacked ensemble model where the base level consists of three distinct model families: a random forest for robustness, a simple linear regression for stable baseline predictions, and a lightweight neural network with only one hidden layer and ReLU activation to capture non-linear trends in key continuous variables. The predictions from these models are then combined using a meta-learner (a gradient-boosted regressor) trained on the base model outputs. This leverages diverse modeling paradigms to improve generalization and reduce variance, while the meta-learner learns optimal weighting of different model contributions. Apply temporal cross-validation with a rolling 1-year window to ensure temporal consistency and avoid data leakage. Feature scaling is applied only to numeric inputs, and categorical variables are one-hot encoded with frequency-based imputation for missing values.",
