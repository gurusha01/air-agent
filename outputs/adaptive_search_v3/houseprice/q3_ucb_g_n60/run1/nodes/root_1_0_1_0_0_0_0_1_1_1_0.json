  "strategy": "Introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model that explicitly models neighborhood-level price dynamics as a nested structure: first, group zip codes into larger metropolitan regions (e.g., city districts), then model each region as a random effect with shared priors. This allows the model to capture both local variation and regional trends, while incorporating uncertainty in price predictions via posterior distributions. Use spatially informed priors derived from historical price correlations to guide the hierarchical structure. Train on the full dataset with cross-validation across regions to ensure robustness, and optimize R2 by penalizing overfitting to noisy local signals. This approach fundamentally shifts from neural network-based relational modeling to probabilistic inference with structured priors.",
