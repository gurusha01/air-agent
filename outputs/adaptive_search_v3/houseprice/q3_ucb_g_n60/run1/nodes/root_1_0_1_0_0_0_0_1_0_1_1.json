  "strategy": "Replace the transformer-based model with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using feature interactions explicitly engineered via polynomial terms (up to degree 3) and recursive feature elimination to reduce noise. Introduce synthetic features derived from temporal patterns in property transactions (e.g., monthly price trends in neighborhoods) using rolling statistics and lagged variables. Apply recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to select top 50 features, and use target encoding with smoothing to stabilize categorical variables. This approach leverages tree-based non-linearity and interpretable feature interactions while reducing overfitting through regularization and feature pruning.",
