  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal convolutional network (STCNN) that jointly models both temporal dynamics and spatial proximity by applying 2D convolutions over a spatial grid (e.g., latitude-longitude bins) with embedded time steps. This allows the model to capture localized trends and spillover effects across neighborhoods while preserving temporal evolution. Use high-resolution geographic data to define spatial bins and incorporate lagged price movements as temporal channels. This approach combines spatial convolution with time-series embedding, enabling the model to learn neighborhood-level patterns through learned spatial filters and temporal shifts.",
