  "strategy": "Replace the transformer-based model with a gradient-boosted tree ensemble (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using target-aware feature interactions. Instead of modeling feature dependencies via self-attention, use tree-based splits to capture non-linear, high-order interactions between features such as square footage \u00d7 neighborhood quality, age \u00d7 renovation status, and lot size \u00d7 proximity to amenities. Apply recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to prune redundant or noisy features, and introduce weighted boosting where feature importance is inversely proportional to feature variance to emphasize meaningful signals. This leverages tree models' strength in handling complex, non-linear patterns without requiring explicit positional or interaction embeddings.",
