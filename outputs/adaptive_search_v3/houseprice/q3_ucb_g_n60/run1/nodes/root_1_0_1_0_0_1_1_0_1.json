  "strategy": "Replace the TCN-based model with a lightweight random forest regressor that uses temporal features derived from hierarchical clustering of neighborhoods by time period (e.g., grouping neighborhoods into temporal clusters based on price evolution over 5-year intervals). For each cluster, extract statistical summaries (mean, median, variance) of price and size over time, then use these as static features. Apply a time-aware permutation-based feature importance method to prioritize temporal patterns that correlate with price stability. This approach leverages ensemble interpretability and non-parametric modeling to capture abrupt shifts in housing trends without assuming linear or sequential dynamics.",
