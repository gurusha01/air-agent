  "strategy": "Introduce a neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE) model to capture dynamic, time-dependent patterns in housing prices by modeling the continuous evolution of price trends over time. Instead of discrete time steps, the model learns continuous latent dynamics from time-series features (e.g., price history, seasonal trends), allowing it to interpolate and extrapolate price changes smoothly. Preprocess time-series features using differencing and Fourier transforms to extract periodic components, then feed these into the Neural ODE framework. Use temporal cross-validation with sliding windows to ensure time consistency. This approach leverages continuous modeling to capture underlying dynamics that tree-based models may miss.",
