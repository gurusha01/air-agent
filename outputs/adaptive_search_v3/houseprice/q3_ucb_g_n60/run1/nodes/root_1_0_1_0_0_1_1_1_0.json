  "strategy": "Apply a dynamic deep learning model using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with residual connections and attention mechanisms to capture both long-range dependencies and local price fluctuations. Instead of using fixed lagged features, introduce adaptive lags based on historical volatility (e.g., rolling standard deviation of price changes) to dynamically select relevant time lags per neighborhood. Combine this with a temporal attention layer that weights past price observations by their predictive relevance, enhancing sensitivity to significant price shifts. Use time-based cross-validation with a 5-year training window and a 1-year holdout period, and apply log-transformed prices with a learned offset to stabilize variance. This approach leverages adaptive feature selection and attention-based temporal modeling to improve dynamic price pattern recognition.",
