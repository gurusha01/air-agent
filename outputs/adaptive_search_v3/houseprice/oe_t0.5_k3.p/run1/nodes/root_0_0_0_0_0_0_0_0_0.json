  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosted tree ensemble with a neural network architecture using a mixture of fully connected layers and attention mechanisms to dynamically weight feature importance during training. Introduce batch normalization and dropout layers to stabilize training and reduce overfitting. Use a custom loss function that incorporates a weighted mean squared error with a penalty term for large residuals to improve robustness to outliers. Train on a stratified subset of the data with data augmentation via synthetic sampling (e.g., Gaussian noise injection) to improve generalization.",
