This model naturally captures complex non-linear relationships and interactions through splitting rules and tree-based learning, while being robust to outliers and missing data. Perform hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization focusing on learning rate, tree depth, and subsample ratio to maximize R\u00b2. This approach leverages the strength of tree-based models in regression tasks with structured data like house prices.",
