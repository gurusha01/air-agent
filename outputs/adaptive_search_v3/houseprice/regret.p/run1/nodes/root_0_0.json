  "strategy": "Replace the polynomial feature expansion with a gradient boosting machine (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) using tree-based splits to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data. Instead of modeling curvature via polynomials, use decision trees to recursively partition the feature space and fit locally optimized models. Apply feature importance pruning and early stopping during training to prevent overfitting. This approach naturally captures interactions and non-linearities without explicit polynomial construction, offering more robust modeling of heterogeneous price drivers.",
