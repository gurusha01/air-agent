  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting ensemble with a stacked ensemble that combines a random forest for feature importance-driven feature selection, a gradient-boosted tree (XGBoost) for primary prediction, and a lightweight neural network (MLP with 2 hidden layers) to model non-linear residuals. Use a feature selection pipeline where the random forest identifies the most stable and correlated features, and then apply a neural network to capture residual patterns that the tree models miss. This hybrid approach leverages the interpretability of trees and the residual modeling power of neural networks, while maintaining computational feasibility.",
