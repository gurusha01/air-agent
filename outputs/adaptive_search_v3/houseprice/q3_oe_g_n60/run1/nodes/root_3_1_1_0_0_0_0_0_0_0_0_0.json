  "strategy": "Introduce a time-series decomposition approach using seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) on transaction volumes and price changes per neighborhood, followed by a lightweight random forest regressor trained on the decomposed components (e.g., trend, seasonality, residual). This strategy isolates and models periodic patterns (e.g., seasonal housing demand spikes in spring) and long-term trends separately, allowing the model to capture non-linear, non-stationary dynamics that traditional attention or TCN models might miss. The decomposed features are then combined with basic neighborhood demographics (e.g., population density, median income) to improve generalization across diverse regions.",
