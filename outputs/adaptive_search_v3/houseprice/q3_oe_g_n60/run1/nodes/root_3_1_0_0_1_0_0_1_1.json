  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosting model with a neural network architecture featuring deep residual blocks and layer-wise adaptive learning rates, using a custom loss function that penalizes predictions in rare housing price quartiles more heavily. Introduce batch normalization and dropout at intermediate layers to improve generalization, and apply target encoding with smoothing on categorical variables using a weighted k-NN imputation strategy. This approach captures complex, non-linear interactions through deep function approximation, potentially outperforming tree-based models in capturing subtle patterns in price distributions.",
