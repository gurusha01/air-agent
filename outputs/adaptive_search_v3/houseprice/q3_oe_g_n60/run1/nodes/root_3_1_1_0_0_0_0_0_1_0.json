  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a random forest ensemble and apply target encoding with smoothing for categorical variables, while introducing orthogonal forest-based feature interactions by decomposing continuous features into sine and cosine components (Fourier features) to capture periodic patterns in time-based or cyclical variables (e.g., month, day of week). Use bootstrap aggregating (bagging) with feature sampling to enhance stability and reduce overfitting on high-dimensional interaction spaces.",
