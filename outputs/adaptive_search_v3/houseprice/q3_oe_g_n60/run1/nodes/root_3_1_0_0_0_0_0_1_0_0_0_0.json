  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal convolutional network (STCNN) that models house prices as a function of both geographic location and time-varying market trends. Treat the housing data as a spatiotemporal grid where each house is a cell, and apply 2D convolutions over neighborhood grids to capture spatial patterns (e.g., price gradients across districts) and temporal dynamics (e.g., price shifts over time). Incorporate lagged price features and seasonal indicators as inputs. This approach leverages convolutional operations to detect local patterns in both space and time, enabling the model to learn how price dynamics evolve across regions and time periods, which is especially effective in markets with strong regional trends or economic cycles.",
