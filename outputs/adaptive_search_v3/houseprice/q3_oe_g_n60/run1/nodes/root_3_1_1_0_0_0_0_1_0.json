  "strategy": "Introduce a stacked ensemble of lightweight gradient-boosted models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) with feature-level bagging, where each model is trained on a subset of the original features derived via recursive feature elimination (RFE) and principal component analysis (PCA). The predictions from each base model are combined using a learned attention-weighted fusion layer in a shallow neural network, allowing the ensemble to adaptively focus on informative feature interactions. This strategy leverages the robustness of tree-based models in capturing non-linearities while incorporating the flexibility of neural fusion to improve generalization in sparse regions of the feature space.",
