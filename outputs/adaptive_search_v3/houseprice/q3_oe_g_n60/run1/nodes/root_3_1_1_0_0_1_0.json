Instead of relying on clustered neighborhoods, use spatial autocorrelation features derived from geospatial coordinates (e.g., distance-to-major-roads, elevation gradients, and neighborhood density) as continuous inputs. Apply feature scaling via robust scaling and incorporate a time-aware component (e.g., year built or construction era) as a categorical embedding. Use cross-validated R2 scoring with stratification by income percentile to ensure high-income and low-income districts are well-represented in each fold.",
