  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal attention mechanism using a Transformer-based architecture that models both geographic proximity and time-series trends in housing prices (e.g., monthly price changes by neighborhood). Each house is represented as a sequence of temporal price observations, and the model uses self-attention to capture long-range dependencies across time and space. Spatial embeddings are derived from geographic coordinates, and cross-neighborhood interactions are modeled via positional encodings. This approach leverages temporal dynamics and spatial coherence beyond static graph structures, potentially uncovering patterns like seasonal price fluctuations or neighborhood trend shifts that traditional GNNs or baselines miss.",
