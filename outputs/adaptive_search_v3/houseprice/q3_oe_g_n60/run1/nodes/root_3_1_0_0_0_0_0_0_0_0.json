  "strategy": "Replace the deep neural network with a random forest ensemble incorporating permutation feature importance-based weighting to dynamically adjust feature contributions during training. Introduce synthetic features using contrastive learning on neighborhood and property type pairs to capture latent spatial relationships. Apply quantile normalization to categorical variables to reduce skew and improve model robustness, while using a rolling window approach to generate dynamic lagged price features that consider seasonal trends (e.g., summer vs. winter sales). Evaluate using a nested time-series cross-validation with stratification by year and region to ensure temporal validity.",
