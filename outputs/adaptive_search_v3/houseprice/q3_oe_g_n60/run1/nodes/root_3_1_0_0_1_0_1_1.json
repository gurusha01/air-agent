  "strategy": "Replace the DNN with a random forest ensemble with gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost with tree-depth regularization and subsampling), and introduce feature interaction terms by generating polynomial features up to degree 2 using only numeric predictors. Apply target encoding for categorical variables with smoothing to reduce noise. Train using a custom objective that penalizes under-prediction more heavily to improve R\u00b2, and use cross-validation with stratified splits based on price quartiles to ensure balanced performance across price ranges. This approach leverages tree-based interactions and robust handling of non-linearities while maintaining interpretability and stability.",
