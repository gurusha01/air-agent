  "strategy": "Introduce a random forest ensemble with gradient boosting (e.g., LightGBM or XGBoost) using tree-depth regularization and feature interactions via interaction terms in the feature space. Instead of relying on deep neural networks, leverage the robustness of ensemble tree models to capture non-linear patterns and handle skewed distributions. Apply targeted feature selection using mutual information with target variables to prioritize predictive features, and use quantile-based binning of continuous variables to reduce noise and introduce non-linearity in a structured way. Train with a validation metric that tracks R\u00b2 and apply early stopping based on R\u00b2 decay to prevent overfitting.",
