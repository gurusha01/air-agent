  "strategy": "Replace the gradient-boosting model with a deep neural network (DNN) using a residual block architecture and layer-wise adaptive learning rates. Introduce batch normalization and dropout with dynamic rates based on feature variance. Apply targeted data augmentation by generating synthetic housing records using Gaussian process interpolation on spatial and neighborhood features. Optimize the DNN using early stopping and R\u00b2 as the primary metric, with a focus on capturing complex, non-linear interactions across high-dimensional categorical and continuous features. This approach shifts from tree-based interpretability to dense, high-capacity non-linear modeling, potentially uncovering hidden patterns in feature interactions.",
