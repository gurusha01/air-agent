  "strategy": "Introduce a spatial-temporal attention mechanism using a transformer-based architecture, where both house features and temporal trends (e.g., historical price changes in neighborhoods over time) are encoded as sequences. The model learns to attend to relevant houses or time periods based on spatial proximity and market dynamics, effectively capturing evolving neighborhood trends. Use geospatial embeddings derived from latitude/longitude to represent houses, and incorporate lagged price features to model time-dependent pricing patterns. Apply target encoding with smoothing and add distance-based features as before, but prioritize attention weights over traditional GNN message passing to focus on dynamically relevant neighbors. Optimize using Bayesian optimization on R\u00b2 with early stopping.",
