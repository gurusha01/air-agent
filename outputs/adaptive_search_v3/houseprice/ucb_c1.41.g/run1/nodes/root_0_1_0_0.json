  "strategy": "Replace the gradient boosting model with a neural network architecture (e.g., a deep feedforward network) using a small ensemble of dense layers with batch normalization and dropout. Apply polynomial feature engineering on key numerical variables (e.g., age squared, area times price) to capture non-linear interactions. Use target encoding with hierarchical smoothing (e.g., lambda = 0.05) for categorical variables and apply log transformation only to features with skewness > 0.5. Train the model with early stopping on cross-validation to prevent overfitting, and use a learning rate scheduler to stabilize training dynamics. This leverages the non-linear capacity of neural networks to model complex interactions that gradient boosters may miss.",
