Instead of relying on polynomial expansions, use tree-based models that naturally capture non-linear patterns and interactions between features through recursive splitting. Incorporate feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of house price, and use early stopping to prevent overfitting. This approach leverages ensemble learning to model complex, non-linear relationships without explicit feature engineering.",
